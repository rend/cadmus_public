We cannot give you anyadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independentFinancial Adviser HUB Financial Solutions, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let meknow so that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.The property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. Ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommendthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to thelenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. If the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.Equity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) tobe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.Homes for Ukraine CampaignYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by theGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST informyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediatelybreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs anyloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes forUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than theinitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted inall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.Tax or Financial adviceWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about givingaway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.ChargesIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your Equity Release.Fees and ExpensesPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3600.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on theassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signingappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.The fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has nounusual features.

As soon as we are aware of any we will notify you.Additional Works \u2013 OccupiersIt is a condition of the transaction that you must obtain a clear legal title to the property without any other person having rights of occupation over theproperty which have priority to any claim which the product provider may make in the future to obtain possession and to sell it free from any rights ofpossession, there will be an additional fee to write to your occupiers of \u00a355.00 plus VAT per occupier.Your occupier will be sent an Occupier Waiver Deed by us once the Equity Release offer is issued by your lender.  This document is issued by your Lenderand as such we are unable to amend or vary the form in any way, other than correct any spelling mistakes.  Each lender has slightly different requirementsand please be aware that the document may state the Equity Release loan amount.  If your lender does state the value of the loan, this is not somethingthat they will agree to remove except in very rare and bespoke circumstances which must be referred to the Lender for their specific authority.If the provision of this information to your Occupier is likely to cause difficulties such that you would prefer the loan amount not to be on the OccupiersWaiver Form, please contact me to discuss the reasons for this which I will then raise with the Lender\u2019s and their solicitors directly.  Please do this at theearliest opportunity as completion will not be set without the completed Occupiers Waiver form and often Lender\u2019s may need to take instruction fromtheir funders and/or their insurers as to whether they can vary the agreed format document.  This can take a number of weeksYour occupier may require ILA and we suggest sourcing a suitable solicitor now, so that an appointment can then be booked in as soon as we receive yourmortgage offer which will also contain \u2019s requirements regarding your occupier and the relevant document for your occupier(s).Unregistered LandIn England and Wales there are two systems operating to prove ownership of property. Under the Land Registration Act 2002 it became mandatory for allland to be registered (when a specific event occurred e.g. sale or re-mortgage), however there remain a small proportion of properties which have not yetbeen become registered.  I have searched the Land Registry for your property and it appears that it may be unregistered.  If you believe it is registeredplease contact me with your title number.If your property is unregistered I require the (complete) original title deeds, evidencing your ownership and any benefits or rights that affect your propertyin order to progress your Equity Release.  The deeds must be sent by us to the Lender\u2019s solicitors to prove ownership and to be registered with the LandRegistry on completion.  Once your property is \"Registered\" the \u201cdeeds\u201d become obsolete as the Land Registry electronic record describes the land, itsowners, any rights/restrictions affecting it and there is a detailed plan of the boundaries,  The Government \u201cguarantees\u201d that the record is accurate for anyfuture transactions.Please send your deeds back to me as soon as possible, or if you do not have them please identify their whereabouts to me.  I recommend keeping copiesof the deeds and, when sending your originals that you do this via special recorded delivery.There is a Land Registry fee payable by you for first registration.  The fee is tapered according to your property\u2019s value, which I will confirm once I haveyour equity release offer which contains the current property valuation.If you are unable to find your deeds please let me know as soon as possible. If your deeds have been lost it is possible to reconstitute your deeds, but this is a time consuming (and additional cost) process which will delay your EquityRelease whilst your property is registered.  Lenders will not proceed until it is proven that you own the property. Application for First Registration take approximately 4 months (from application) to registration.We recognise that the deeds have historic interest to you and we always request their return, but the Land Registry default approach is to destroy thedeeds (as they are now defunct for the purposes of proving your ownership) and they are not always returned to us.  When/if the deeds are returned to uswe will return them to you.My fees for the additional work are on request.Signed PlanPlease find enclosed a plan, obtained from the Land Registry, outlining what I believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and returnto me.  If the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent.  It is important that the plan is accurate. If you own any additional land, pleaseidentify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct.Next StepsPlease review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested toenable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to Equilaw such as account details for existing charges,details of any occupiers or your management company (if Leasehold) details.  On receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offerthrough to completion. The offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lender\u2019s solicitors (who will then send it to us).We will issue and send you a \"Legal Report Pack\". This pack will come directly from Equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you willreceive from JUST directly.Offers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. We will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from JUST's solicitors.\f"}

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should beaware of the possible consequences:In certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberatedeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore needto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you areseeking.Should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (forexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement ofthe gift.Making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to considercovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) theyare to be considered when distributing your estate.We have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from HUB Financial Solutions and it may be that you havealready addressed the matter with them.

As soon as we are aware of any we will notify you.Additional Works \u2013 OccupiersIt is a condition of the transaction that you must obtain a clear legal title to the property without any other person having rights of occupation over theproperty which have priority to any claim which the product provider may make in the future to obtain possession and to sell it free from any rights ofpossession, there will be an additional fee to write to your occupiers of \u00a355.00 plus VAT per occupier.Your occupier will be sent an Occupier Waiver Deed by us once the Equity Release offer is issued by your lender.  This document is issued by your Lenderand as such we are unable to amend or vary the form in any way, other than correct any spelling mistakes.  Each lender has slightly different requirementsand please be aware that the document may state the Equity Release loan amount.  If your lender does state the value of the loan, this is not somethingthat they will agree to remove except in very rare and bespoke circumstances which must be referred to the Lender for their specific authority.If the provision of this information to your Occupier is likely to cause difficulties such that you would prefer the loan amount not to be on the OccupiersWaiver Form, please contact me to discuss the reasons for this which I will then raise with the Lender\u2019s and their solicitors directly.  Please do this at theearliest opportunity as completion will not be set without the completed Occupiers Waiver form and often Lender\u2019s may need to take instruction fromtheir funders and/or their insurers as to whether they can vary the agreed format document.  This can take a number of weeksYour occupier may require ILA and we suggest sourcing a suitable solicitor now, so that an appointment can then be booked in as soon as we receive yourmortgage offer which will also contain \u2019s requirements regarding your occupier and the relevant document for your occupier(s).Unregistered LandIn England and Wales there are two systems operating to prove ownership of property. Under the Land Registration Act 2002 it became mandatory for allland to be registered (when a specific event occurred e.g. sale or re-mortgage), however there remain a small proportion of properties which have not yetbeen become registered.  I have searched the Land Registry for your property and it appears that it may be unregistered.  If you believe it is registeredplease contact me with your title number.If your property is unregistered I require the (complete) original title deeds, evidencing your ownership and any benefits or rights that affect your propertyin order to progress your Equity Release.  The deeds must be sent by us to the Lender\u2019s solicitors to prove ownership and to be registered with the LandRegistry on completion.  Once your property is \"Registered\" the \u201cdeeds\u201d become obsolete as the Land Registry electronic record describes the land, itsowners, any rights/restrictions affecting it and there is a detailed plan of the boundaries,  The Government \u201cguarantees\u201d that the record is accurate for anyfuture transactions.Please send your deeds back to me as soon as possible, or if you do not have them please identify their whereabouts to me.  I recommend keeping copiesof the deeds and, when sending your originals that you do this via special recorded delivery.There is a Land Registry fee payable by you for first registration.  The fee is tapered according to your property\u2019s value, which I will confirm once I haveyour equity release offer which contains the current property valuation.If you are unable to find your deeds please let me know as soon as possible. If your deeds have been lost it is possible to reconstitute your deeds, but this is a time consuming (and additional cost) process which will delay your EquityRelease whilst your property is registered.  Lenders will not proceed until it is proven that you own the property. Application for First Registration take approximately 4 months (from application) to registration.We recognise that the deeds have historic interest to you and we always request their return, but the Land Registry default approach is to destroy thedeeds (as they are now defunct for the purposes of proving your ownership) and they are not always returned to us.  When/if the deeds are returned to uswe will return them to you.My fees for the additional work are on request.Signed PlanPlease find enclosed a plan, obtained from the Land Registry, outlining what I believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and returnto me.  If the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent.  It is important that the plan is accurate. If you own any additional land, pleaseidentify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct.Next StepsPlease review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested toenable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to Equilaw such as account details for existing charges,details of any occupiers or your management company (if Leasehold) details.  On receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offerthrough to completion. The offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lender\u2019s solicitors (who will then send it to us).We will issue and send you a \"Legal Report Pack\". This pack will come directly from Equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you willreceive from JUST directly.Offers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. We will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from JUST's solicitors.3\f"}

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should beaware of the possible consequences:In certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberatedeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore needto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you areseeking.Should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (forexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement ofthe gift.Making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to considercovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) theyare to be considered when distributing your estate.We have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from HUB Financial Solutions and it may be that you havealready addressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity releasefunds, we recommend that you do so.  I enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. Once you havecompleted the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience.

Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  Our ChargesOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will chargeyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay outon your behalf (disbursements).  Where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have beennotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that noadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with thescope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete yourwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and completeany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the workdone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement tothis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property isfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.

Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for thecost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown inthe additional fees schedule.ShortfallIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, togetherwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertakechecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, andwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly andseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part ofa bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case wewill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which cansignificantly increase the amount owed.  You agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any otherassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on yourbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment ismade.

Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make thepayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.We expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due forpayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterlingeither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  Shortfalls and Completion FundsWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you areborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  Weare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.Payment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019We occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order tohelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guaranteescheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, fromthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Anypayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. It is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept clientmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a generalclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  We will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it isconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:the nature of the transaction;amounts held and their duration;the purpose of us holding the funds.Due to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)Regulation and limits on our servicesWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or surveyreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on thesuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritanceplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.

{"FileID": "128503", "FileType": "PDF", "FileNameSubject": "128503/13.pdf", "PageNo": "14", "Note": "", "Origin": "128503/13.pdf", "Context": "FAQ1. Do I have to send in my title deeds? If your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Titledirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via yourdirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  If your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authorityallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  2. I have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well? We are required, by your Lender\u2019ssolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sightof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then anIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but theattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us toprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.3. I have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you? We have to providedetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for yourfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it willdelay your case if it expires prior to completion.4. Do I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation? Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a keyrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequencesof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuringthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present forthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, pleaserefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.5. How do I book my solicitors appointment? Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer anappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to youwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hourtime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (daybefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment tooccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings providedbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. I cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? We can almost always arrange for one of ourmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for youwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sentinstructions prior to the appointment.7. The solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, ifa specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.8. Should we update our Wills at the same time? Making a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made orupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making aLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have adrawdown product. 9. Why should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? Your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions orproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experiencedspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,Twitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.10. When will you be in touch with me? There are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending thenet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriateand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.14\f"}

These fraudsters have realisedthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone callcontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by acombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to thefraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and thesolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.We take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in theirapproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).

These fraudsters have realisedthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone callcontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by acombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to thefraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and thesolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.We take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in theirapproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).

We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing. We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dialtelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working dayand to respond to written communications within two working days. Your ResponsibilitiesYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,so that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/worktelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstanceschange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  Our ChargesOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will chargeyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay outon your behalf (disbursements).  Where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have beennotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that noadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with thescope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete yourwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and completeany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the workdone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement tothis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property isfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreedthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equityrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.Solicitors\u2019 AppointmentsWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment givingless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, wewill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.Note also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity releaseapplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of theappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment. You must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.Indemnity InsuranceOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the clientand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for thecost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown inthe additional fees schedule.ShortfallIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, togetherwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertakechecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, andwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note thatpayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly andseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part ofa bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case wewill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which cansignificantly increase the amount owed.  You agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any otherassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on yourbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment ismade.  Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility forany errors or delays once the funds leave our account. Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make thepayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.We expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due forpayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterlingeither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  Shortfalls and Completion FundsWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you areborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  Weare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.Payment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019We occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order tohelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guaranteescheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, fromthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Anypayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. It is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept clientmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a generalclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  We will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it isconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:the nature of the transaction;amounts held and their duration;the purpose of us holding the funds.Due to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)Regulation and limits on our servicesWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or surveyreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on thesuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritanceplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.

If your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Titledirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via yourdirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  If your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authorityallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  2. I have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well? We are required, by your Lender\u2019ssolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sightof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then anIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but theattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us toprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.3. I have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you? We have to providedetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for yourfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it willdelay your case if it expires prior to completion.4. Do I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation? Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a keyrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequencesof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuringthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present forthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, pleaserefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.5. How do I book my solicitors appointment? Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer anappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to youwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hourtime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (daybefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment tooccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings providedbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. I cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? We can almost always arrange for one of ourmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for youwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sentinstructions prior to the appointment.7. The solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, ifa specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.8. Should we update our Wills at the same time? Making a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made orupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.

You are required to explain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.

If you are advising a client in relation to an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent of the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013 \u00b7the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or Wales); or\u00b7the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\u00b7the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of Scotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which take place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s Rules & GuidancePayment of Fees Whilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to this guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients to you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to you.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not be calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.This also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected with the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative or marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel membership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of staff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision or purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).  For the avoidance of doubt, certain marketing payments which are not connected with payment on a case-by-case basis are permitted, subject to the regulatory obligations of the parties concerned. You must inform your client(s) in writing of the amount and frequency of any financial arrangement, including marketing contributions, when issuing the customer case documentation at the outset.If the customer chooses not to instruct their own legal adviser, the adviser or provider (as appropriate) may offer the name of at least one local law firm which has knowledge of equity release products.  The adviser or provider must ensure that no pressure or financial inducement is involved in directing customers to any particular law firm either by them or the intermediaries recommending their products.Receipt of Payments If you are acting on behalf of the client you may not receive payments or other consideration from the adviser or provider if that payment is dependent on the completion of an equity release transaction. \f"}

This must be their main residence on  a continual basis. For joint applications, customers must own the property on either a joint tenants or tenants in common basis. \u2022 Own an acceptable property worth \u00a370,000 or over in the UK. Please see our \u2018Lending Criteria Guide\u2019 for further details.Initial advance The minimum initial advance is \u00a310,000 (or \u00a320,000 if some or all of the monthly interest is being paid). This must be drawn on completion of the lifetime mortgage. The initial advance will be paid to the account of the customer\u2019s legal adviser. If any part of the initial advance is needed to  pay off an outstanding mortgage or secured loan, this amount will be  paid directly to the lender. All payments will be made in sterling. Cash facility Customers have the option of taking a cash facility at the start of their lifetime mortgage. The interest rate applicable to the initial advance and any subsequent borrowing will be higher than if this option were not selected. The maximum cash facility will be capped at the maximum LTV available based on the age of the youngest customer (with an absolute maximum of \u00a3200,000 remaining in the facility). The unused cash facility will therefore be the balance of the maximum loan amount permitted by customer age less the initial advance.The cash facility is guaranteed to be available for the life of the mortgage, unless one of the following occurs:  \u2022If the total of all the advances exceeds the maximum loan amount based on the borrowers age and property value at the time the request for an additional advance is made. \u2022If we, or another provider (if we have transferred the lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages. \u2022If the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time the request for an additional advance is made. \u2022If the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either party has died. \u2022If a default event occurs. \u2022If, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the additional advance. \u2022If a second charge has been registered on the property.We sometimes accept applications on behalf of individuals by attorneys. But there must be a suitable enduring or lasting power of attorney registered  with the relevant authority in the country of residence.Call 0345 302 2287 or visit justadviser.com\f"}

These are subject to a minimum of \u00a32,000 per release,  and the customer won\u2019t have to take further financial advice. We do not charge any administration fee for a release from the existing cash facility. Monthly payment option Customers can choose to pay some or all of the monthly interest amount by Direct Debit. The minimum they can pay is \u00a325, up to 100% of the monthly interest amount. A reduction to the roll-up interest rate may apply for customers who decide to pay some or all of the monthly interest amount, this will be detailed in the customers offer documentation.If they need to take a temporary break from the monthly payments, providing they give us 1 months notice, they can take a payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in any 12 month period following the completion of the loan. The monthly interest not paid during the payment holiday will be added to the loan and roll up on a compound basis.If they wish to stop making monthly payments altogether, they can do so at any time, at which point the lifetime mortgage will switch to a full roll-up of interest basis. For customers who received a reduction to the roll-up interest rate due to paying some or all of their monthly interest amount, the interest rate applicable to the loan will increase. Once payments have ceased they cannot be restarted. The loan will convert to a full interest roll-up basis once 6 monthly payments have been missed and the interest rate applicable may increase.Medically underwritten option Using our expert underwriting capability, depending upon the underlying customer need, customers who qualify for this option may be able to borrow a loan at a higher loan-to-value or achieve their borrowing requirements at a lower rate of interest than an \u2018equivalent\u2019 healthy customer.A medical questionnaire is required to determine whether the customer(s) will qualify for enhanced terms.

Additional advances are not guaranteed, and we\u2019ll decide whether we can provide additional borrowing depending on: \u2022the customer\u2019s circumstances; \u2022the value and condition of the property; and  \u2022our lending criteria at the time.Additional advances are subject to a minimum of \u00a35,000, and customers  must take advice from an authorised financial adviser. A property valuation may be needed for additional advances outside the cash facility. If so, we\u2019ll charge for this, which won\u2019t be more than the normal valuation fee applicable to new business at the time. There\u2019s no administration fee for additional advances. Additional advances can be requested by the customer(s) directly or via an authorised financial adviser in writing, by phone, email, or fax. There\u2019s no administration fee for this.Call 0345 302 2287 or visit justadviser.com\f"}

The rate is guaranteed for six weeks from the date of issue of the offer. If the advance isn\u2019t completed within six weeks, the offer will expire. Any replacement offer will be in line with the terms available at the time, so the interest rate may change. Interest is charged on a monthly basis and added to the outstanding balance each month on the payment due date. Interest is charged from the date the advance is released to the borrower\u2019s legal adviser, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full, or in the event of early repayment until the latter of either the date the amount owed is repaid in full or if repaid before the end of the 14 day notice period until the end of that notice period.For additional advances the interest rate will be set at the time it\u2019s requested. Customers will be informed of the rate in writing. Once again, this interest rate will be guaranteed for six weeks from the date the confirmation is issued. If the additional advance is not drawn within six weeks of the confirmation, the offer will expire. Any replacement offer will be in line with the terms available at the time, so once again the interest rate may change. Please note, in section 8 of the Key Facts Illustration (KFI) we take into account calendar years rather than compounding years. Therefore if the customer is servicing 100% of the monthly interest amount, the balance in the table in section 8 may include some interest. For example, if a customer completes their initial advance on 2 January 2021 and has chosen to service 100% of their monthly interest amount with a payment date of the 15th of each month, section 8 of the KFI would show in year 1 the balance at the end of  2 January 2022. By this date interest has accumulated from 15 December 2021 (the last payment) to 2 January 2022. However the customer hasn\u2019t had a chance to pay that off as their direct debit date isn\u2019t until 15 January 2022. Therefore the interest that has been accumulated is included in the balance  in section 8.Fees, remuneration and charges To find out more about fees, remuneration and charges, see our \u2018Just For You Lifetime Mortgage \u2013 at a glance\u2019 guide.

It\u2019s designed to be repaid only when your customer (or both customers, in the case of borrowing jointly) has died or permanently moved into long-term care.The mortgage must be repaid within 12 months from when your customer (or both customers in the case of borrowing jointly) has died or permanently moved into long-term care. For example, your customer might move into a care home or live with and be cared for by relatives on a permanent basis due to medical necessity. If the mortgage isn\u2019t repaid within 12 months, we may appoint  a representative to market and sell the property. If the mortgage is repaid at any time before the death or entry into permanent long-term care of all applicants, then the customer(s)  may have to pay an early repayment charge. The mortgage may also have to be repaid if the property is left vacant  for more than three months. Usually the mortgage will be repaid from the sale proceeds of the property, but it can be repaid from other funds if needed. Voluntary early repayment If your customer(s) repay their lifetime mortgage early, there may be an early repayment charge to pay. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of their decision not to keep the mortgage for the full term. We do not charge an exit administration fee for early repayment. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if the lifetime mortgage is repaid early.   We offer two different Early Repayment Charge options: Variable and Fixed.  The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to the offer letter to understand which option applies to the Lifetime Mortgage.Further details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash examples are included in the Initial Advance Offer and each Additional Advance Offer. The Guide to our early repayment charge contains helpful information about Early Repayment Charges.    If your customer pays back their lifetime mortgage in full, we won\u2019t charge an early repayment charge if: \u2022the mortgage is repaid after they die or permanently move into long-term care; or \u2022if they\u2019ve held their mortgage for longer than the early repayment period. If your customers have borrowed jointly, we won\u2019t charge an early repayment charge if the lifetime mortgage is repaid: \u2022within three years of the death of one borrower; Call 0345 302 2287 or visit justadviser.com\f"}

If not making monthly payments, customers are able to repay some of their lifetime mortgage without having to pay an early repayment charge. For each advance, they can pay back up to 10% of the advance amount in each 12-month period following completion, in up to six instalments providing they are not servicing any of the monthly interest amount. The minimum overall amount they can pay in each instalment is \u00a3500, and the remaining amount owed must be at least \u00a310,000. If more than one advance has been taken, we will allocate the amount repaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. If the amount repaid is more than 10% there may be an early repayment charge payable. Also, if the customer(s) sell their property and transfers the lifetime mortgage to a new property that is acceptable to us, we may ask them to make a part repayment. This may happen, for example, if the customer(s) new property is worth less than their existing one. If this happens, we won\u2019t charge an early repayment charge on that part repayment.No-negative-equity guarantee As long as the customers have complied with the terms and conditions, they won\u2019t have to pay more than the sale proceeds of the property, even if it\u2019s less than the amount owed. There\u2019s no added charge for this guarantee. Valuation report Before we make an offer, we need a property valuation which is an estimation of the worth of the customer\u2019s property carried out by a professional valuer. We choose a surveyor to carry out the valuation. Moving home If your customers want to move home, it may be possible to transfer their lifetime mortgage to a new property, if the new property is acceptable to us. One condition is that the sale of the old property and purchase of the new property take place at the same time. If the new property has a higher value than the old property, it may be possible to apply for a further advance. But this is subject to the lending criteria at the time. In some instances, for example if the customer is transferring the lifetime mortgage to a lower value property, we may reduce the cash facility. We may ask the customer to repay part of the amount owed in line with lending criteria applicable at the time. We do not charge an application fee for transferring the lifetime mortgage. If the customer has taken more than one advance, we will allocate the amount repaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. There will be no early repayment charge in these circumstances. If customers choose to repay more than required, an early repayment charge will apply only to the extra amount repaid. The new property will need to be valued by a surveyor. We\u2019ll choose a surveyor to do the valuation. The valuation fee will be the fee applicable to a new Just Lifetime Mortgage at the time. Your customer will be responsible for all the costs of moving. Find out more about early repayment charges in our \u2018Guide to early  repayment charge\u2019.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in some instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.You do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as described in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently leave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before this time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, Mortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents.1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority:a) your Offer Pack;b) Tariff of Charges;c) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; andd)  Mortgage Deed.2. Your Cash Facility2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The amount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.3. Your Initial Advance3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an amount agreed between us and you.

Additional AdvancesYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your most recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. If you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to this Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer.4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The amount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your Initial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to the value of the Unused Cash Facility. 4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional Advance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the Interest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that will apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable to the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your acceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of the Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your Additional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  bank account.4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  secured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5. Your Unused Cash Facility5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any Additional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each time you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the Amount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee for your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not affect the Unused Cash Facility.5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your Unused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional Advance Offer.45Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  Additional AdvancesThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an Additional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have not used all of your Cash Facility. 6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you:a) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the Maximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage Agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; d) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the Property), and either party has died; e) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  Section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the Additional Advance;org) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section 29.2 for more details of this restriction).6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional Advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  to provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does not Complete.6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to value the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will refund the Valuation Fee to you.6Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Increasing your Cash FacilityWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing.  You can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this section. You will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement. If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional  Advance Offer.7.2 If we agree to increase your Cash Facility, you will be able to take an Additional Advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new Unused Cash Facility. After you have taken the Additional Advance up to the full amount of your Unused Cash Facility, the Unused Cash Facility will be zero.7.3 If you decide to request an increase to your Cash Facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated Fees. Your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice.  7.4 If we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. Your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for  their advice.7.5 We may obtain a new valuation of the Property from an independent, qualified Valuer. If we do, you will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. 7.6 If you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your Cash Facility. Also, to be eligible for an increase in your Cash Facility, you and the Property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your Cash Facility.7Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The Property as securityYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional Advances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime.8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have signed and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the Property at the Land Registry.8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose.8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else.9. InterestThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these Monthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). 9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. The Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or lower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  an Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  time we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance. 98Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will be notified of the Interest Rate applicable to such Fees and Costs at the time they are added. The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 Interest is charged daily at the Interest Rate on each amount which forms part of the Amount Owed, from the date that amount is added to the Amount Owed, until the date the Amount Owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in Section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 The interest that is charged daily forms part of the Amount Owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged:a) for Advances, from the date the relevant Advance Completes; or b) for any other amount (including Fees and Costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the Amount Owed.Each month, the interest that is charged daily is \u2018rolled-up\u2019, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.9.7 Interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the Amount Owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before.9.8 A lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the Amount Owed.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Monthly paymentsAs part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make Monthly Payments against the amount of interest charged. The amount of your ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  Once your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop making your Monthly Payments altogether.  If you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the Monthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-up\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making Monthly Payments they cannot be restarted. This Section explains more about your options.10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance you can select to make Monthly Payments.10.2 For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum of \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.10.3 For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly Payments on your Initial Advance.10.4 The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the Advance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.10.5 Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month.10.6 Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your Monthly Payments. 10.7 You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to giving us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. The Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term.10.8 You may request one Payment Holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following Completion of the Initial Advance, providing you give us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Interest not paid during a Payment Holiday will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will \u2018roll up\u2019 on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage.10.9 If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment for any month within 3 working days of the next Monthly Payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments and you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

These Special Conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the Property as recommended by the Valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  14.1 We may apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these Special Conditions are set out in your Offer.  Special Conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage Agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve  the conflict.14.2 We may ask you to satisfy Special Conditions before your lifetime mortgage Completes.

Insuring the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we want to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a mortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.25.1 You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you will not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if the Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. In that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it.25.2 The insurance policy must:a) be with a reputable insurer;b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to cover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the Property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  pay for alternative accommodation;c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  other index as we reasonably require;d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require;e) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the Advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  is the earliest; andf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two Business Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.25.3 Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy.25.5 You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  to date.25Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If we insure the Property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. You will need to pay the Costs that we incur in insuring the Property. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs.25.8 You can ask us for details of any insurance we have put in place  in respect of the Property.26. Insurance claims26.1 You must tell us as soon as possible if there is any significant loss  or damage to the Property.26.2 You must take reasonable steps to make sure that nothing  happens which may harm your or our ability to make a claim  under the insurance.26.3 If it is necessary to make a claim on your insurance you must tell the insurance company as soon as possible and assist the insurance company to resolve the claim. 26.4 We may also make a claim on your insurance and negotiate and settle any claims on your behalf.26.5 The claims money must be used to make good any loss or damage it has been paid for, or if we agree with you, it will be used to reduce or repay the Amount Owed. If there has been significant loss or damage to the Property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us.27. Maintaining the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the Property. We will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the Property to a standard that exceeds the condition at the time we valued the Property, unless your Offer was subject to Special Conditions requiring repairs or other work to be carried out.27.1 During your lifetime mortgage you must maintain the Property  in good condition and repair and replace fixtures and fittings  when necessary.27.2 You must carry out any repairs or other works required by us  as a condition of your Offer by the date set by us.

Making changes to the Property You must tell us if you wish to alter the Property. We will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the Property, but we have put in place safeguards. These safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the Property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard.28.1 You must not alter the Property structurally, extend or convert the Property or change the use of the Property unless you have our written permission to do so. You will be responsible for paying for the cost of preparing any plans or reports required by us, and all the expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not  give permission.28.2 You must obtain all necessary planning permission and building regulations approval for the Property. You must ensure that any obligations concerning the Property, including under the planning permission and in your title deeds, are complied with.28.3 All building works must be carried out to an acceptable standard by appropriate qualified contractors. We may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to inspect the completed works and you will need to pay a non-refundable Fee for this.29. Other secured borrowingYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the Property. Other lenders may not be willing to lend to you because we have a first charge on the Property and the Amount Owed will increase due to the roll-up of interest.2928Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Repayment on death and Long Term CareYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. This section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. We recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event.You might also need to repay early if there is a Default Event, which is described in Section 43 of this booklet.35.1 You can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. The Amount Owed, including all of the interest, Fees and Costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the Property, although the Amount Owed can be repaid from other funds.35.2 A \u201cRepayment Event\u201d will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. The Amount Owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the Repayment Event. You must tell us as soon as possible in writing  if a Repayment Event occurs.  35.3 In the event of your death, your personal representative must notify us of this in writing and provide us with a death certificate and any other documentation that we reasonably require.35.4 If you permanently leave the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care, you must provide us with written confirmation from a suitably qualified doctor or other medical or care professional who is acceptable to us. This confirmation must be in the form we reasonably require, and must confirm that you require Long Term Care and provide details of the Long Term Care arrangements.

No negative equity guaranteeYour lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity guarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount Owed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.36.1 You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. If we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might be less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment Charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.36.2 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale Proceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms of Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee.36.3 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough to cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  Amount Owed.36.4 In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably believe that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, we may spend money on the Property in order to make it more marketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the Property. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged. We will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). We will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the Property is sold. If we are unable to sell the Property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the Property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 If you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the Property has been reduced, and/or the Amount Owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the Sale Proceeds being less than the Amount Owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a Repayment Event.If you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.You should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.37.1 If you repay all or part of the Amount Owed before a Repayment Event as explained in Section 35 (which explains when a Repayment Event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as set out in more detail below. Early Repayment Charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in Section 41.37.2 We require at least 14 days\u2019 written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. We will then calculate the Amount Owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any Early Repayment Charge due at that time).37.3 You can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the Amount Owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period.37.4 If the Amount Owed is repaid as a result of a Default Event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge may be payable.37Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Making a partial repayment will not increase your Unused Cash Facility, but may reduce your Cash Facility.If you are making Monthly Payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge and Section 38.7 will not apply.You should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.38.1 If there is any repayment of part of the Amount Owed, we may reduce your Cash Facility and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.38.2 Each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your Initial Advance Offer  unless the conditions set out in Section 38.7 are met in respect  of that partial repayment. Section 38.7 does not apply if you  are making Monthly Payments and so any partial repayment  you choose to make whilst making Monthly Payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an Early Repayment Charge. 38.3 We will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the Amount Owed to a value that is less than (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) the minimum Initial Advance as set out in your Initial Advance Offer. This does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the Property.38.4 If there is any partial repayment it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately. If you have more than one Advance, or Costs and Fees have been added to the Amount Owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your Advances, and the Costs and Fees that have been added (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 If you are making Monthly Payments, as detailed within Section 10, then Section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge if those repayments are within the Early Repayment Period.38.6 Partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the Advance without being subject to an  Early Repayment Charge provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:38Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Any partial repayment will be allocated between Advances and any Fees and Costs in proportion to the Advance and Fees and Costs when  compared to the Amount Owed. The partial repayment will  be allocated between capital and interest. This split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and  the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest).b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in Section 38.6, an Early Repayment Charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the Early Repayment Period. This charge could be zero . If this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. If the Early Repayment Charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.39. Early Repayment ChargesIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early.We offer a two different Early Repayment Charge options; Variable and Fixed. The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your Offer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime Mortgage. Further details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash examples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each Additional Advance Offer.

Fees and Costs may be applied to the Advance and these will increase the Amount Owed. Please refer to the Definitions section for details on when Fees and Costs may be applied. The Early Repayment Charge will be applied to the total Amount Owed. 39.2 A maximum Early Repayment Charge will apply to your Initial Advance and will be shown in your Initial Advance Offer A maximum Early Repayment Charge will also apply to each Additional Advance and will be shown in each Additional  Advance Offer 39.3 If you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.Variable Early Repayment Charge 39.4 The Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining Early Repayment Period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use Benchmark Interest Rates to take account of these movements). The way we calculate the Variable Early Repayment Charge is set out in your Offer. We have set out a worked example of how the Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated in the Early Repayment Charge guide.Fixed Early Repayment Charge 39.5 The Fixed Early Repayment Charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid.  The amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest.  The Early Repayment Charge percentage will reduce throughout the Early Repayment Period.  After the end of the Early Repayment Period, an Early Repayment Charge will not be payable. The Fixed Early Repayment Charge structure and a worked example is set out in your Offer and our Early Repayment Charge Guide40. Benchmark Interest Rates (applicable to the Variable Early Repayment Charge only)The Variable Early Repayment Charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use \u201cBenchmark Interest Rates\u201d to take account of these movements. For this, we use the UK FTSE 15 Year Gilt Yield Index. This Index is published daily in The Financial Times (under \u201cGilts \u2013 UK FTSE Actuaries Indices\u201d, \u201cYield Indices\u201d, \u201c15 yrs\u201d). For each Advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the Offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. Your Offer will show the Benchmark Interest Rate and the Target Benchmark Interest Rate for the Advance.40.1 On any Business Day, we use the Benchmark Interest Rate published on the previous Business Day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the Business Day before that.40Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

What is a breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement? If you fail to do something you agreed to do, for example insuring and maintaining the Property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the Property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement. This section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement.If there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage Agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home.42.1 If you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage Agreement then this is a breach.42.2 If a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. We will allow you a reasonable time to do so. We will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the Property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender.42.3 If you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the Property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. For example, this may require us to enter the Property and carry out repairs.42.4 If we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask,  we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply  to those Costs.42.5 Where we have to take action or incur Costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of Costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement (whether or not we add Costs to the Amount Owed because you have not paid them).42.6 If you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee.

What is a Default Event?A Default Event is an event that could lead to serious consequences: for example we could require you to repay the Amount Owed early or it could lead to possession and sale of the Property.

If you do not pay these when we ask you to, then these amounts will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged.45. Appointment of a property receiver Where a Default Event occurs we can appoint a receiver for all or part of the Property. The receiver will act as your agent and this means you are responsible for their costs and their actions. We, or the receiver, can do anything that you could do with the Property, such as signing documents to do with your lifetime mortgage Agreement or the Property. If your Property is in Scotland, we have rights under the standard security but these do not include appointing a receiver. We are entitled to exercise our rights and remedies ourselves. Please see Section 55.9.45.1 If a Default Event occurs, or if the Property or our security appears to be at risk (for example, another creditor takes enforcement action in respect of the Property), then we have the right to appoint a receiver. We can do this without giving you any prior notice. We can also remove the receiver and choose whether or not we need to appoint another one.45.2 None of the restrictions made by the Law of Property Act 1925 in relation to the appointment apply.45.3 Any receiver we appoint will be regarded as your agent and you will be responsible for the receiver\u2019s actions and omissions.

The law that applies to your lifetime mortgageYour lifetime mortgage is governed by the laws set out below. Any disputes that arise out of, or in connection with your lifetime mortgage can be settled in a court of law as set out below.52.1 If the Property is in England or Wales, your lifetime mortgage Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.52.2 If the Property is in Scotland, your lifetime mortgage Agreement  is governed by the laws of Scotland.52.3 If the Property is in Northern Ireland, your lifetime mortgage Agreement is governed by the laws of Northern Ireland.52.4 The terms of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the United Kingdom in which the Property is located. This means if the Property is located in England or Wales, the competent court will be the courts of England and Wales. If the Property is located in Scotland, the competent court will be the Scottish courts. If the Property is located in Northern Ireland, the competent court will be the courts in Northern Ireland.52.5 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way.52.6 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are not consistent with anything in an Offer, the terms of the Offer will apply.53. Changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement53.1 We can make reasonable changes to your lifetime mortgage Agreement in the following circumstances:a) to make the terms of the lifetime mortgage Agreement easier to understand or fairer to you; b) to reflect an improvement of any service or facility we supply  in connection with your mortgage; c) to introduce a new service; d) to replace an existing service with a new one (but only where this would not be to your disadvantage);e) to correct any obvious error that might be found in the  future in relation to the written terms of the lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5352Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Giving notice54.1 We will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters we send will be sent to you at the Property, unless you have given us another address to use.54.2 You must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters you send must be sent to Just Retirement Money Limited at the address in the \u2018About us\u2019 section, unless we have given you another address to use.55. Variations for Properties in Scotland Due to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland then this section will apply to you.55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If the Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. In Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy.55.2 Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, this means a standard security under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security.55.3 In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are references to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for a house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that they do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d means owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property under a lease.5455Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will see reference to a court judgement in Section 9.7.55.5 Section 15 refers to occupiers.  In Scotland, if the occupier is  your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the Property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have.55.6 Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives.55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.55.8 If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into possession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  sell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 Act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 Act.55.9 There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section 45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.55.10 5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver.55.11 We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. We may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. You will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs. If the Property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. If we sell the Property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. If we sell the Property and the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Important information from the Financial Conduct Authority: \uf0b7 A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or a regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the sale of your home after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death of the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries.  \uf0b7 If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Any money left over belongs to you.  \uf0b7 If you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Again, any money left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs to move into long-term care, you don't usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either dies or moves into long-term care or another Property.  \uf0b7 If you decide that you simply don't want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount you owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an Early Repayment Charge if you do. Section 13 of this Offer document will tell you if any Early Repayment Charges apply to this mortgage.  \uf0b7 Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment - this means you borrow a lump sum which is invested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the full details of the investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents together.   \f"}

References to \u2018Just\u2019 in this Offer Document include Just Retirement Money Limited and anyone to whom we transfer, assign, or who otherwise has the benefit of, your lifetime mortgage at the time.  \uf0b7 You require a Cash Facility of \u00a3137,500.00.  \uf0b7 You require an Initial Advance of \u00a395,000.00 from this Cash Facility.

If a full inspection of the Property has not been carried out prior to Completion, we will need to arrange a full valuation at our expense in the future.   Both the initial and full valuations that will be carried out on the Property, and changes to any of the information you have given us, could alter the information elsewhere in this Offer Document. If this is the case please ask for a revised Offer Document. The valuation will also be used to confirm that your Property meets our lending criteria.      \f"}

Description of this mortgage  This Offer Document is for a Saga Lifetime Mortgage provided by Just.   Interest Rate The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate of 6.75% (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage).  See Section 9 for more information regarding the Interest Rates that will apply to Additional Advances.   The Interest Rate applicable to the Initial Advance may be offered as a reduction to our current Interest Rate. Any reduction from the current Interest Rate that is applied to the Initial Advance will not be applied to borrowing from the Unused Cash Facility.  Interest Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage.  This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in Section 8.  Eligibility At the time of application, the Saga Lifetime Mortgage is only available to borrowers aged 55 and over.  The minimum Initial Advance is \u00a310,000.00, subject to your Property being acceptable to us and meeting our minimum Property value requirements.  Initial Advance This lifetime mortgage provides you with an Initial Advance of \u00a395,000.00 at Completion.  Cash Facility You will be able to borrow up to the amount of your Cash Facility of \u00a3137,500.00 (including the Initial Advance), unless certain exceptional circumstances apply as described in Section 14.  When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. See Section 14, \u2018Additional secured borrowing\u2019 for more details.  Unused Cash Facility The maximum amount that you may borrow, from your Cash Facility, following your Initial Advance, is \u00a342,500.00. This will be referred to as your Unused Cash Facility.  Additional Advances You can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property, which must be for at least the Minimum Additional Advance amount of \u00a32,000.00. Additional Advances are subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement and will be based on the terms available from Just at the time, as described in Section 14.   In exceptional circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the exceptional circumstances described in Section 14 apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you.  Estimated term We have based this Offer on an estimated term of 16 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 16 years. If you are still living in your home at the end of 16 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run. \f"}

Risks \u2013 important things you must consider  No negative equity guarantee Your lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity guarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the Sale Proceeds, even if it is less than the Amount Owed.  There is no additional charge for this guarantee. If we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might be less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment Charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to assess the Property value. You will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.  Moving home If you move home you can transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new Property that is acceptable to us. The new Property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to transfer your lifetime mortgage. You will have to pay Fees to us, including a Valuation Fee and an Arrangement Fee. You will also be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if the transfer does not complete. We will assess the security provided by the new Property (for example if it is of a lower value than the Property), and we may reduce your Cash Facility and ask you to repay part of the Amount Owed. If you decide not to transfer your lifetime mortgage, or we do not give our permission because, for example, the new Property is not acceptable to us and you wish to proceed with the move anyway, you must repay the Amount Owed and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as described in Section 13.  Repayment of the lifetime mortgage A \"Repayment Event\" will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. The Amount Owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the Repayment Event. You must tell us as soon as possible in writing if a Repayment Event occurs. In these circumstances, no Early Repayment Charges will be payable, as described in Section 13.  Early Repayment Charges If you repay all or part of the amount owed before the repayment event, then this will be treated as early repayment, unless you are covered by the money back guarantee. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as described in Section 13.   Future Interest Rates The interest rate for additional advances could be higher or lower in the future, as described in section 9.  Access to Additional Advances In Exceptional circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances as described in section 14. For example, a significant increase in the benchmark interest rate or a significant fall in property values may mean that your unused Cash Facility is suspended.  Inflation Inflation may erode the value of your advances and Cash Facility over time.  Tax and state benefits Taking out this lifetime mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits and may also affect your tax position. Tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need further advice you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, the Pension Service, Jobcentre Plus or your local Citizens Advice. \f"}

The actual term may be longer or shorter than the estimate. If it is longer the Amount Owed will be greater. Please ask your financial adviser if you would like another illustration based on a different term.  Change of circumstances Your circumstances might change after you take out this lifetime mortgage.  Repair and maintenance of the Property During your lifetime mortgage you must maintain the Property in good condition and repair and replace fixtures and fittings when necessary. We may decide to inspect the Property, but we will tell you at least 14 days before we intend to do this, unless there is an emergency at the Property. If the Property is not being maintained then we may ask you to carry out the repairs at your own expense. If the repairs are not made, we may arrange for the repairs to be carried out on your behalf and you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, interest will also apply to those Costs.   Other secured borrowing You must ask for our written permission if you want another mortgage or loan from another lender secured on the Property, sometimes referred to as a second charge, or wish to use the Property as security in any other way. Requests for another charge or securing other interests against the Property will be subject to individual consideration. Other lenders may not be willing to lend to you because we have a first charge on the Property and the Amount Owed will increase due to the roll-up of interest.  Other occupiers Other occupiers, for example relatives, friends or carers, will not have the right to live in the Property after you (or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you) have died, or have permanently left the Property. It is important that they understand this and we may ask them to sign an occupier consent form with the help of an independent legal adviser.  Adding a new borrower After your lifetime mortgage has Completed, you may be able to add another person as a joint borrower, subject to our lending criteria being met at the time you apply. You will also need our written permission. To add a new borrower, you will have to pay Fees to us, which might include a Valuation Fee and an Arrangement Fee. You will also be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if the transfer does not complete. If we are not reasonably satisfied that the Property provides adequate security for the new arrangement, we may reduce your Cash Facility and we may ask you to repay part of the Amount Owed. In this instance, you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as described in Section 13.  Default Event If a Default Event occurs, we have the right to take legal action to take possession of the Property and/or sell it to repay the Amount Owed. If the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you, for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries. We may take possession and/or sell the Property for any of the following reasons: \uf0b7 You do not repay the Amount Owed when it becomes payable.  \uf0b7 You do not repay the Amount Owed within 12 months from when you or each of you, if you are borrowing jointly, die, or permanently leave the Property for the purpose of Long Term Care.  \f"}

What happens if you do not want this mortgage anymore?   Early repayment charges Your lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care.   You have to pay early repayment charges if you want to repay all or part of your lifetime mortgage during the Early Repayment Period applicable to that advance for reasons other than those shown below. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a repayment event.   The Early Repayment Period will be shown in your Offer for each Advance.  We have based this illustration on an Early Repayment Period of 15 years.  In the first year following completion of the advance, the early repayment charge will be 10% of the amount repaid.  The early repayment charge percentage will reduce by 1% each year until year 10 where it remains at 1% until the end of year 15.  The following cash examples show the early repayment charges you would have to pay if the advance was repaid in full. Each additional advance will attract its own early repayment charge as set out in the offer we give you for that advance.

If you move home you can transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property that is acceptable to us. The new property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to transfer your lifetime mortgage, as described in Section 7.   Circumstances in which Early Repayment Charges do not apply  An Early Repayment Charge is not payable if: \uf0b7 Repayment of your lifetime mortgage happens after you or each of you, if you are borrowing jointly, die or permanently leave the Property for the purposes of long term care and the evidence you have provided is reasonably satisfactory to us.  \uf0b7 Repayment of your lifetime mortgage happens within 3 years of the death or entry into permanent care of one borrower if you are borrowing jointly and the evidence you have provided is reasonably satisfactory to us.  \uf0b7 For each advance, repayment of that advance happens after the early repayment period applicable to that advance has ended.  \uf0b7 You want to move home and the new property meets our lending criteria at the time, provided that we allow you to transfer, and you transfer your lifetime mortgage to the new property.  \uf0b7 You want to move home and the new Property meets our lending criteria at the time, and you make a part repayment equal to an amount required by us because the new Property does not provide enough security (for example you move to a home of lesser value), provided that we allow you to transfer, and you transfer your lifetime mortgage to the new Property.  \uf0b7 You are repaying your lifetime mortgage within the first 6 month period following completion of the initial advance, as permitted under the money back guarantee feature described within Section 6.  \uf0b7 The amount of the repayment falls within the terms and conditions of Partial repayments without Early Repayment Charges as shown within Section 14.  Further information on Early Repayment Charges The guide to our Early Repayment Charge contains helpful information about Early Repayment Charges and can be made available on request.  If any part of this section is unclear to you, you should contact your financial adviser.   14. Additional features  Additional borrowing without further approval The maximum amount that you may borrow, from your cash facility, following your initial advance, is \u00a342,500.00.  This will be referred to as your unused cash facility. You can request an additional advance at any time while you are still living in the property, which must be for at least the minimum additional advance amount of \u00a32,000.00. Additional advances are subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement and will be based on the terms available from Just at the time.

The overall amount owed includes fees where they have been added to the loan.  Remember that the lifetime mortgage could run for a longer or shorter time than 16 years, and if it runs for longer, the amount you owe will carry on increasing if you are not paying all of the interest. Remember also, that the interest rate on each additional advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the additional advance.  The interest rate could be higher or lower than the interest rate shown above.  We provide an additional advance Offer confirming the interest rate each time we agree to provide you with an additional advance. Your lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care.  If you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, you may have to pay a substantial Early Repayment Charge when you repay, as described in Section 13, unless you are covered by the money back guarantee.  The maximum Early Repayment Charge you could pay, if you borrowed the maximum cash facility is \u00a314,707.39. This value is calculated assuming you borrow your full cash facility (rather than borrowing a smaller initial advance) and on the same interest rate used for your initial advance within this document. In exceptional circumstances you will be unable to take additional advances.  If, when you request an additional advance any of the following exceptional circumstances apply, then your unused cash facility will not be available to you: \uf0b7 If the total of the initial advance you have received exceeds the maximum loan amount based on your age and property value at that time. \uf0b7 If Just no longer offers lifetime mortgages. \uf0b7 If the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property. \uf0b7 If the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either one of you dies. \uf0b7 If a default event occurs. \uf0b7 If Just becomes insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA or are otherwise unable reasonably to continue to do business in the lifetime market. \uf0b7 If another charge has been registered on the property.  Additional secured borrowing When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional Advance Offer.  Any increase to your Cash Facility is subject to a minimum increase of \u00a35,000.00. If we agree to increase your Cash Facility, you will need to take an Additional Advance at the same time for the full amount of your new Unused Cash Facility.

Additional Advances will be based on the terms available from Just at the time.  Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing secured on your home.  Overpayments You are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge on partial repayments that do not meet the conditions set out under the heading 'Partial Payments without Early Repayment Charges' (see below). Section 13 describes how this is calculated. Making a partial repayment will not increase your unused cash facility, but may reduce your cash facility. Each partial repayment you choose to make in excess of Partial Repayments without Early Repayment Charges will be subject to a minimum payment of \u00a32,000.00. We will not accept a partial repayment, if when applied the Amount Owed, excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable, becomes less than \u00a310,000.00.  If you make a partial repayment, it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately. If you have more than one Advance, or Costs and Fees have been added to the Amount Owed, then the amount you repay will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your Advances and the Costs and Fees that have been added (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable when you make your partial repayment).   Partial repayments without Early Repayment Charges Partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the advance without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: \uf0b7 the total value of partial repayments received in the relevant 12 month period does not exceed 10% of the advance  \uf0b7 no more than a total of 6 partial repayments are made in the relevant 12 month period ; \uf0b7 each partial repayment is \u00a3500 or more; and the partial repayment does not result in the amount owed (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) becoming less than the minimum initial advance as shown in section 5.

We also need to be satisfied with the title to the property (who owns it legally) and that you meet any special conditions in this offer. Most properties are now registered at the land registry. However, we believe the Property is currently unregistered. Our legal advisers will need your title deeds to register the Property at the land registry. Please provide the title deeds to your legal adviser as soon as possible to avoid any delays.  Buildings insurance You must have suitable buildings insurance cover. This should cover at least the rebuilding cost of the property of \u00a3385,000.00. If the sum insured is below this amount, you should speak to your insurer to increase it. Your legal adviser will need to see the original buildings insurance policy schedule.  Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the buildings insurance policy. We can ask for cover as joint insured or co-insured on a \u2018composite\u2019 basis. \u2018Composite\u2019 insurance is another way of covering more than one person under an insurance policy.  Your legal adviser can explain the difference and may also arrange this for you.  Your initial advance When your lifetime mortgage completes, we will pay the initial advance to your legal adviser. Remember, legal advisers may take off legal fees or disbursements (payments for things like writing letters and so on) owed to them, before paying you the initial advance. Your legal adviser can tell you how much this will be.  Just to recap, what do you need to do next? We understand there\u2019s a lot to think about. If you want to go ahead, this checklist might help you. \u25a1 Ask your legal adviser to act for you (we\u2019ve enclosed a \u2018letter of instruction\u2019 to help). \u25a1 Check your buildings insurance and contact your insurer (if you need to increase the sum insured). \u25a1 Make arrangements to meet any special conditions needed before completion. \u25a1 Arrange to see your legal adviser, taking with you: \u25a1 a form of identification (your legal adviser will tell you what\u2019s needed) \u25a1 the original buildings insurance policy schedule, your original title deeds and \u25a1 anything else your legal adviser needs. \u25a1 At the meeting, your legal adviser will ask you to sign: \f"}

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in some instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.You do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as described in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently leave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before this time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, Mortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents.1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority:a) your Offer Pack;b) Tariff of Charges;c) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; andd)  Mortgage Deed.2.

Additional AdvancesYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your most recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. If you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to this Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer.4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The amount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your Initial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to the value of the Unused Cash Facility. 4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional Advance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the Interest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that will apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable to the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your acceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of the Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your Additional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  bank account.4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  secured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5. Your Unused Cash Facility5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any Additional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each time you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the Amount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee for your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not affect the Unused Cash Facility.5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your Unused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional Advance Offer.45Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  Additional AdvancesThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an Additional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have not used all of your Cash Facility. 6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you:a) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the Maximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage Agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; d) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the Property), and either party has died; e) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  Section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the Additional Advance;org) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section 29.2 for more details of this restriction).6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional Advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  to provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does not Complete.6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to value the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will refund the Valuation Fee to you.6Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Increasing your Cash FacilityWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing.  You can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this section. You will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement. If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional  Advance Offer.7.2 If we agree to increase your Cash Facility, you will be able to take an Additional Advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new Unused Cash Facility. After you have taken the Additional Advance up to the full amount of your Unused Cash Facility, the Unused Cash Facility will be zero.7.3 If you decide to request an increase to your Cash Facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated Fees. Your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice.  7.4 If we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. Your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for  their advice.7.5 We may obtain a new valuation of the Property from an independent, qualified Valuer. If we do, you will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. 7.6 If you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your Cash Facility.

The Property as securityYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional Advances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime.8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have signed and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the Property at the Land Registry.8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose.8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else.9. InterestThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these Monthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). 9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. The Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or lower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  an Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  time we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance. 98Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will be notified of the Interest Rate applicable to such Fees and Costs at the time they are added. The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 Interest is charged daily at the Interest Rate on each amount which forms part of the Amount Owed, from the date that amount is added to the Amount Owed, until the date the Amount Owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in Section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 The interest that is charged daily forms part of the Amount Owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged:a) for Advances, from the date the relevant Advance Completes; or b) for any other amount (including Fees and Costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the Amount Owed.Each month, the interest that is charged daily is \u2018rolled-up\u2019, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.9.7 Interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the Amount Owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before.9.8 A lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the Amount Owed.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Monthly paymentsAs part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make Monthly Payments against the amount of interest charged. The amount of your ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  Once your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop making your Monthly Payments altogether.  If you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the Monthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-up\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making Monthly Payments they cannot be restarted. This Section explains more about your options.10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance you can select to make Monthly Payments.10.2 For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum of \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.10.3 For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly Payments on your Initial Advance.10.4 The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the Advance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.10.5 Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month.10.6 Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your Monthly Payments. 10.7 You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to giving us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them.

If any Monthly Payment falls due on a day which is not a Business Day, we will collect on the next Business Day.11. Fees that you may need to pay Throughout this booklet we refer to Fees that you may need to pay to us.

The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement.12.3 Where we add Fees or Costs to the Amount Owed, they will be treated in the same way as Advances for the purposes of charging interest and Early Repayment Charges, determining how much of your Unused Cash Facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the Amount Owed.13. The term of your lifetime mortgage13.1 Your Offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. The term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. Your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage Agreement continues to apply until the Amount Owed is repaid in full.14. Special ConditionsIn some instances we may need to apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage. These Special Conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the Property as recommended by the Valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  14.1 We may apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these Special Conditions are set out in your Offer.  Special Conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage Agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve  the conflict.14.2 We may ask you to satisfy Special Conditions before your lifetime mortgage Completes. Where Special Conditions require you to take some action in relation to the Property after your lifetime mortgage Completes you will have 6 months from the date of Completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing.14.3 We may require you to provide documents to confirm that a Special Condition in relation to the Property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the Property.

Insuring the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we want to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a mortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.25.1 You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you will not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if the Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. In that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it.25.2 The insurance policy must:a) be with a reputable insurer;b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to cover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the Property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  pay for alternative accommodation;c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  other index as we reasonably require;d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require;e) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the Advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  is the earliest; andf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two Business Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.25.3 Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy.25.5 You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  to date.25Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If we insure the Property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. You will need to pay the Costs that we incur in insuring the Property. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs.25.8 You can ask us for details of any insurance we have put in place  in respect of the Property.26.

If there has been significant loss or damage to the Property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us.27. Maintaining the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the Property. We will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the Property to a standard that exceeds the condition at the time we valued the Property, unless your Offer was subject to Special Conditions requiring repairs or other work to be carried out.27.1 During your lifetime mortgage you must maintain the Property  in good condition and repair and replace fixtures and fittings  when necessary.27.2 You must carry out any repairs or other works required by us  as a condition of your Offer by the date set by us.

Making changes to the Property You must tell us if you wish to alter the Property. We will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the Property, but we have put in place safeguards. These safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the Property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard.28.1 You must not alter the Property structurally, extend or convert the Property or change the use of the Property unless you have our written permission to do so.

You must ensure that any obligations concerning the Property, including under the planning permission and in your title deeds, are complied with.28.3 All building works must be carried out to an acceptable standard by appropriate qualified contractors. We may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to inspect the completed works and you will need to pay a non-refundable Fee for this.29. Other secured borrowingYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the Property.

The Interest Rate applicable at the time of the transfer will continue to apply after the transfer other than in relation to the Arrangement Fee. If you add this to the Amount Owed you will be notified of the Interest Rate applicable to such Arrangement Fee at the time it is added. The Interest Rate applying to your Arrangement Fee will be summarised in your annual statement. 32.4 You will also be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if the transfer does not complete.32.5 If we do not give our permission for the transfer of your lifetime mortgage and you wish to proceed, you will have to repay the Amount Owed and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.33. What if you want someone to move into the Property?If someone else permanently moves into the Property, then you must tell us. The new occupant will not have the right to continue to live in the Property when you die or permanently leave the Property.If you are borrowing on your own and you wish to transfer the Property into joint ownership, then your lifetime mortgage will need to be transferred too. The transfer is subject to the new occupant being eligible for your lifetime mortgage and being acceptable to us.In some instances we may reduce your Cash Facility and you may have to repay part of the Amount Owed. This is because the amount you are entitled to borrow from us depends on the age of the borrowers and other factors.33.1 After your lifetime mortgage has Completed, you must tell us if you want someone else to move into the Property to live with you, for example a family member, a new partner or a carer. Occupiers will not have the right to live in the Property after your death or when you permanently leave the Property.33.2 We may require the new occupier to sign an occupier consent form, with the help of an independent legal adviser, confirming that they will move out of the Property after your death or when you permanently leave the Property.3233Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

This section describes this process and who pays for the valuation.34.1 We may require further valuations of the Property during your lifetime mortgage even though you have not asked for a change in your lifetime mortgage. We will be responsible for paying the cost of the valuation in this circumstance.34.2 If you ask us to make a change to your lifetime mortgage, for example if you apply for an increase in your Cash Facility or if you ask for our permission, for example, to sell part of the Property, and we reasonably require a valuation, then you will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property takes place.34.3 All valuations will be instructed by us and carried out by an independent, qualified Valuer qualified through the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

Repayment on death and Long Term CareYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. This section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. We recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event.You might also need to repay early if there is a Default Event, which is described in Section 43 of this booklet.35.1 You can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. The Amount Owed, including all of the interest, Fees and Costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the Property, although the Amount Owed can be repaid from other funds.35.2 A \u201cRepayment Event\u201d will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. The Amount Owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the Repayment Event. You must tell us as soon as possible in writing  if a Repayment Event occurs.  35.3 In the event of your death, your personal representative must notify us of this in writing and provide us with a death certificate and any other documentation that we reasonably require.35.4 If you permanently leave the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care, you must provide us with written confirmation from a suitably qualified doctor or other medical or care professional who is acceptable to us. This confirmation must be in the form we reasonably require, and must confirm that you require Long Term Care and provide details of the Long Term Care arrangements. You should provide us with this confirmation before you leave the Property so that we can confirm whether this would be an early repayment and whether an Early Repayment Charge may  be payable.35.5 If the information provided in the written confirmation is not reasonably satisfactory to us, or is not provided before your lifetime mortgage is repaid, then payment of the Amount Owed will be regarded as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge will be payable if the payment is within the Early Repayment period.35.6 Following a Repayment Event, you (or your personal representatives in the event of your death) must, without delay, take all reasonable steps to market the Property for sale and to negotiate the best possible price reasonably obtainable for the Property. You must obtain our written consent to the sale.35Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

No negative equity guaranteeYour lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity guarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount Owed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.36.1 You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. If we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might be less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment Charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.36.2 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale Proceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms of Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee.36.3 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough to cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  Amount Owed.36.4 In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably believe that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, we may spend money on the Property in order to make it more marketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the Property. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged. We will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). We will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the Property is sold. If we are unable to sell the Property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the Property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 If you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the Property has been reduced, and/or the Amount Owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the Sale Proceeds being less than the Amount Owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Early repaymentYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care.If you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, and repayment of an Advance happens during the Early Repayment Period which is set out in the Offer for that Advance, you may have to pay a substantial Early Repayment Charge when you repay. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a Repayment Event.If you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.You should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.37.1 If you repay all or part of the Amount Owed before a Repayment Event as explained in Section 35 (which explains when a Repayment Event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as set out in more detail below. Early Repayment Charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in Section 41.37.2 We require at least 14 days\u2019 written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. We will then calculate the Amount Owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any Early Repayment Charge due at that time).37.3 You can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the Amount Owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period.37.4 If the Amount Owed is repaid as a result of a Default Event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge may be payable.37Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Partial repaymentYou are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, subject to certain limits specified in the Offer Pack and as set out in Section 38.7 below, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge on any partial repayment that you make in excess of these limits. Making a partial repayment will not increase your Unused Cash Facility, but may reduce your Cash Facility.If you are making Monthly Payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge and Section 38.7 will not apply.You should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.38.1 If there is any repayment of part of the Amount Owed, we may reduce your Cash Facility and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.38.2 Each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your Initial Advance Offer  unless the conditions set out in Section 38.7 are met in respect  of that partial repayment. Section 38.7 does not apply if you  are making Monthly Payments and so any partial repayment  you choose to make whilst making Monthly Payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an Early Repayment Charge. 38.3 We will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the Amount Owed to a value that is less than (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) the minimum Initial Advance as set out in your Initial Advance Offer. This does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the Property.38.4 If there is any partial repayment it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately. If you have more than one Advance, or Costs and Fees have been added to the Amount Owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your Advances, and the Costs and Fees that have been added (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 If you are making Monthly Payments, as detailed within Section 10, then Section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge if those repayments are within the Early Repayment Period.38.6 Partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the Advance without being subject to an  Early Repayment Charge provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:38Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Any partial repayment will be allocated between Advances and any Fees and Costs in proportion to the Advance and Fees and Costs when  compared to the Amount Owed. The partial repayment will  be allocated between capital and interest. This split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and  the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest).b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in Section 38.6, an Early Repayment Charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the Early Repayment Period. This charge could be zero . If this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. If the Early Repayment Charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.39. Early Repayment ChargesIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early.We offer a two different Early Repayment Charge options; Variable and Fixed. The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your Offer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime Mortgage. Further details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash examples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each Additional Advance Offer.

The Early Repayment Charge will be applied to the total Amount Owed. 39.2 A maximum Early Repayment Charge will apply to your Initial Advance and will be shown in your Initial Advance Offer A maximum Early Repayment Charge will also apply to each Additional Advance and will be shown in each Additional  Advance Offer 39.3 If you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.Variable Early Repayment Charge 39.4 The Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining Early Repayment Period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use Benchmark Interest Rates to take account of these movements). The way we calculate the Variable Early Repayment Charge is set out in your Offer. We have set out a worked example of how the Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated in the Early Repayment Charge guide.Fixed Early Repayment Charge 39.5 The Fixed Early Repayment Charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid.  The amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest.  The Early Repayment Charge percentage will reduce throughout the Early Repayment Period.  After the end of the Early Repayment Period, an Early Repayment Charge will not be payable. The Fixed Early Repayment Charge structure and a worked example is set out in your Offer and our Early Repayment Charge Guide40. Benchmark Interest Rates (applicable to the Variable Early Repayment Charge only)The Variable Early Repayment Charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use \u201cBenchmark Interest Rates\u201d to take account of these movements. For this, we use the UK FTSE 15 Year Gilt Yield Index. This Index is published daily in The Financial Times (under \u201cGilts \u2013 UK FTSE Actuaries Indices\u201d, \u201cYield Indices\u201d, \u201c15 yrs\u201d). For each Advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the Offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. Your Offer will show the Benchmark Interest Rate and the Target Benchmark Interest Rate for the Advance.40.1 On any Business Day, we use the Benchmark Interest Rate published on the previous Business Day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the Business Day before that.40Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

What is a breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement? If you fail to do something you agreed to do, for example insuring and maintaining the Property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the Property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement. This section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement.If there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage Agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home.42.1 If you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage Agreement then this is a breach.42.2 If a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. We will allow you a reasonable time to do so. We will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the Property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender.42.3 If you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the Property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. For example, this may require us to enter the Property and carry out repairs.42.4 If we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask,  we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply  to those Costs.42.5 Where we have to take action or incur Costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of Costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement (whether or not we add Costs to the Amount Owed because you have not paid them).42.6 If you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee.

If you do not pay these when we ask you to, then these amounts will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged.45. Appointment of a property receiver Where a Default Event occurs we can appoint a receiver for all or part of the Property. The receiver will act as your agent and this means you are responsible for their costs and their actions. We, or the receiver, can do anything that you could do with the Property, such as signing documents to do with your lifetime mortgage Agreement or the Property. If your Property is in Scotland, we have rights under the standard security but these do not include appointing a receiver. We are entitled to exercise our rights and remedies ourselves. Please see Section 55.9.45.1 If a Default Event occurs, or if the Property or our security appears to be at risk (for example, another creditor takes enforcement action in respect of the Property), then we have the right to appoint a receiver. We can do this without giving you any prior notice.

Powers to sell the PropertyThis section details what happens when we or a receiver have to sell the Property. There are some additions and qualifications to these provisions in relation to a Property in Scotland. Please see Section 55.11.46.1 We have the power of sale, and other powers from Section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925, over the Property as part of your lifetime mortgage.  For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs.46.2 Section 103 of the Law of Property Act 1925 will not apply to your lifetime mortgage.  (Section 103 would otherwise restrict our powers of sale.) For example, we are not required to give you three months\u2019 notice before we sell the Property.46.3 If we, or the receiver take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a mortgage lender in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property.46.4 If we, or the receiver, have to sell the Property, we or the receiver may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. We may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. You will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs.46.5 If the Property is sold by us, or by a receiver appointed by us, it  can be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us by a lump sum,  in instalments or a partial payment.46.6 If we, or the receiver, sell the Property we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw any contract for sale.46.7 If we, or the receiver sell the Property and the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, assuming there is no-one with  a prior right, anything left over will be given to you, for the benefit  of you or your beneficiaries.General conditionsThis section includes other general conditions that apply to your  lifetime mortgage.47.

Joint and several liability48.1 If you have borrowed on your own you are fully responsible  to pay the Amount Owed and to comply with your lifetime mortgage Agreement.48.2 If you have borrowed jointly then your lifetime mortgage Agreement applies to both of you together and each of you separately. This means that each of you can be individually held fully responsible for complying with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and paying the Amount Owed.49. Rights of third parties49.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement can only be enforced by you, your successors, your personal representatives and us, our successors and any person or company to whom we transfer or assign all or part of our rights under your lifetime mortgage Agreement (which includes your lifetime mortgage).49.2 Your personal representatives and successors will be bound  by your lifetime mortgage Agreement after your death.50. Payments50.1 Whenever you make a payment to us it should always be made during normal banking hours in sterling and come from you to us immediately. If a date for paying us falls on a non-Business Day then the payment should be made on the next Business Day.50.2 All payments to us must be made without set-off and without any deduction on account of any tax, duty or other charge, unless a deduction is required by law. If a deduction is required by law, you will increase the payment so that we receive the amount due to us before the deduction.51. Transfer of your lifetime mortgage51.1 We may transfer (including by declaration of trust), assign or charge all or part of our rights under your lifetime mortgage Agreement (which includes your lifetime mortgage) to another person or company at any time.51.2 If we do this the person or company who takes over the rights we transfer will have the same rights as we have. Your rights and obligations will not be affected by this, and the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement will not change because of this.51.3 We may delegate all or part of our rights and obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement to another person or company at any time.51.4 We may pass on details about you and your lifetime mortgage Agreement to another person or company where we consider it necessary or advisable to do so in connection with any sale or financing arrangement which we may enter into or consider in connection with your lifetime mortgage.51.5 Before we legally assign your lifetime mortgage we will write to  tell you.51.6 You may not transfer, assign or charge all or part of your rights under your lifetime mortgage Agreement to anyone else.48495051Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The law that applies to your lifetime mortgageYour lifetime mortgage is governed by the laws set out below. Any disputes that arise out of, or in connection with your lifetime mortgage can be settled in a court of law as set out below.52.1 If the Property is in England or Wales, your lifetime mortgage Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.52.2 If the Property is in Scotland, your lifetime mortgage Agreement  is governed by the laws of Scotland.52.3 If the Property is in Northern Ireland, your lifetime mortgage Agreement is governed by the laws of Northern Ireland.52.4 The terms of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the United Kingdom in which the Property is located. This means if the Property is located in England or Wales, the competent court will be the courts of England and Wales. If the Property is located in Scotland, the competent court will be the Scottish courts. If the Property is located in Northern Ireland, the competent court will be the courts in Northern Ireland.52.5 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way.52.6 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are not consistent with anything in an Offer, the terms of the Offer will apply.53. Changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement53.1 We can make reasonable changes to your lifetime mortgage Agreement in the following circumstances:a) to make the terms of the lifetime mortgage Agreement easier to understand or fairer to you; b) to reflect an improvement of any service or facility we supply  in connection with your mortgage; c) to introduce a new service; d) to replace an existing service with a new one (but only where this would not be to your disadvantage);e) to correct any obvious error that might be found in the  future in relation to the written terms of the lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5352Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Giving notice54.1 We will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters we send will be sent to you at the Property, unless you have given us another address to use.54.2 You must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters you send must be sent to Just Retirement Money Limited at the address in the \u2018About us\u2019 section, unless we have given you another address to use.55. Variations for Properties in Scotland Due to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland then this section will apply to you.55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If the Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. In Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy.55.2 Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, this means a standard security under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security.55.3 In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are references to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for a house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that they do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d means owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property under a lease.5455Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will see reference to a court judgement in Section 9.7.55.5 Section 15 refers to occupiers.  In Scotland, if the occupier is  your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the Property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have.55.6 Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives.55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.55.8 If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into possession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  sell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 Act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 Act.55.9 There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section 45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.55.10 5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver.55.11 We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. We may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. You will need to pay any Costs we incur.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in some instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.You do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as described in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently leave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before this time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, Mortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents.1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority:a) your Offer Pack;b) Tariff of Charges;c) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; andd)  Mortgage Deed.2. Your Cash Facility2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The amount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.3. Your Initial Advance3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an amount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial Advance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Additional AdvancesYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your most recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. If you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to this Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer.4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The amount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your Initial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to the value of the Unused Cash Facility. 4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional Advance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the Interest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that will apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable to the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your acceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of the Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your Additional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  bank account.4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  secured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5. Your Unused Cash Facility5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any Additional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each time you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the Amount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee for your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not affect the Unused Cash Facility.5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your Unused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional Advance Offer.45Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  Additional AdvancesThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an Additional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have not used all of your Cash Facility. 6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you:a) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the Maximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage Agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; d) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the Property), and either party has died; e) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  Section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the Additional Advance;org) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section 29.2 for more details of this restriction).6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional Advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  to provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does not Complete.6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to value the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will refund the Valuation Fee to you.6Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Increasing your Cash FacilityWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing.  You can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this section. You will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement. If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional  Advance Offer.7.2 If we agree to increase your Cash Facility, you will be able to take an Additional Advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new Unused Cash Facility. After you have taken the Additional Advance up to the full amount of your Unused Cash Facility, the Unused Cash Facility will be zero.7.3 If you decide to request an increase to your Cash Facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated Fees. Your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice.  7.4 If we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. Your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for  their advice.7.5 We may obtain a new valuation of the Property from an independent, qualified Valuer. If we do, you will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. 7.6 If you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your Cash Facility. Also, to be eligible for an increase in your Cash Facility, you and the Property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your Cash Facility.7Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The Property as securityYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional Advances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime.8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have signed and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the Property at the Land Registry.8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose.8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else.9. InterestThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these Monthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). 9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. The Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or lower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  an Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  time we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance. 98Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will be notified of the Interest Rate applicable to such Fees and Costs at the time they are added. The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 Interest is charged daily at the Interest Rate on each amount which forms part of the Amount Owed, from the date that amount is added to the Amount Owed, until the date the Amount Owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in Section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 The interest that is charged daily forms part of the Amount Owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged:a) for Advances, from the date the relevant Advance Completes; or b) for any other amount (including Fees and Costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the Amount Owed.Each month, the interest that is charged daily is \u2018rolled-up\u2019, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.9.7 Interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the Amount Owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before.9.8 A lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the Amount Owed.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Monthly paymentsAs part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make Monthly Payments against the amount of interest charged. The amount of your ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  Once your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop making your Monthly Payments altogether.  If you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the Monthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-up\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making Monthly Payments they cannot be restarted. This Section explains more about your options.10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance you can select to make Monthly Payments.10.2 For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum of \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.10.3 For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly Payments on your Initial Advance.10.4 The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the Advance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.10.5 Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month.10.6 Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your Monthly Payments. 10.7 You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to giving us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. The Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term.10.8 You may request one Payment Holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following Completion of the Initial Advance, providing you give us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Interest not paid during a Payment Holiday will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will \u2018roll up\u2019 on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage.10.9 If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment for any month within 3 working days of the next Monthly Payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments and you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

From time to time, we may review the Fees that we charge and we may add new Fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect :11.3.1  a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services;  or11.3.2  any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take  account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. Any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change  on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business.11.4 If we change the Fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new Tariff of Charges.12. Costs that you may need to pay During your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others.

The term of your lifetime mortgage13.1 Your Offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. The term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. Your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage Agreement continues to apply until the Amount Owed is repaid in full.14.

These Special Conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the Property as recommended by the Valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  14.1 We may apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these Special Conditions are set out in your Offer.  Special Conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage Agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve  the conflict.14.2 We may ask you to satisfy Special Conditions before your lifetime mortgage Completes. Where Special Conditions require you to take some action in relation to the Property after your lifetime mortgage Completes you will have 6 months from the date of Completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing.14.3 We may require you to provide documents to confirm that a Special Condition in relation to the Property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the Property.

Insuring the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we want to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a mortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.25.1 You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you will not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if the Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. In that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it.25.2 The insurance policy must:a) be with a reputable insurer;b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to cover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the Property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  pay for alternative accommodation;c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  other index as we reasonably require;d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require;e) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the Advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  is the earliest; andf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two Business Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.25.3 Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy.25.5 You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  to date.25Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If we insure the Property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. You will need to pay the Costs that we incur in insuring the Property. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs.25.8 You can ask us for details of any insurance we have put in place  in respect of the Property.26.

If there has been significant loss or damage to the Property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us.27. Maintaining the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the Property. We will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the Property to a standard that exceeds the condition at the time we valued the Property, unless your Offer was subject to Special Conditions requiring repairs or other work to be carried out.27.1 During your lifetime mortgage you must maintain the Property  in good condition and repair and replace fixtures and fittings  when necessary.27.2 You must carry out any repairs or other works required by us  as a condition of your Offer by the date set by us.

Making changes to the Property You must tell us if you wish to alter the Property. We will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the Property, but we have put in place safeguards. These safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the Property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard.28.1 You must not alter the Property structurally, extend or convert the Property or change the use of the Property unless you have our written permission to do so.

You must ensure that any obligations concerning the Property, including under the planning permission and in your title deeds, are complied with.28.3 All building works must be carried out to an acceptable standard by appropriate qualified contractors. We may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to inspect the completed works and you will need to pay a non-refundable Fee for this.29. Other secured borrowingYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the Property.

This section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. We recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event.You might also need to repay early if there is a Default Event, which is described in Section 43 of this booklet.35.1 You can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. The Amount Owed, including all of the interest, Fees and Costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the Property, although the Amount Owed can be repaid from other funds.35.2 A \u201cRepayment Event\u201d will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care.

No negative equity guaranteeYour lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity guarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount Owed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.36.1 You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. If we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might be less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment Charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.36.2 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale Proceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms of Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee.36.3 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough to cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  Amount Owed.36.4 In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably believe that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, we may spend money on the Property in order to make it more marketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the Property. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged. We will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). We will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the Property is sold. If we are unable to sell the Property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the Property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 If you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the Property has been reduced, and/or the Amount Owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the Sale Proceeds being less than the Amount Owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Early repaymentYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care.If you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, and repayment of an Advance happens during the Early Repayment Period which is set out in the Offer for that Advance, you may have to pay a substantial Early Repayment Charge when you repay. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a Repayment Event.If you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.You should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.37.1 If you repay all or part of the Amount Owed before a Repayment Event as explained in Section 35 (which explains when a Repayment Event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as set out in more detail below. Early Repayment Charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in Section 41.37.2 We require at least 14 days\u2019 written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. We will then calculate the Amount Owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any Early Repayment Charge due at that time).37.3 You can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the Amount Owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period.37.4 If the Amount Owed is repaid as a result of a Default Event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge may be payable.37Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Partial repaymentYou are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, subject to certain limits specified in the Offer Pack and as set out in Section 38.7 below, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge on any partial repayment that you make in excess of these limits. Making a partial repayment will not increase your Unused Cash Facility, but may reduce your Cash Facility.If you are making Monthly Payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge and Section 38.7 will not apply.You should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.38.1 If there is any repayment of part of the Amount Owed, we may reduce your Cash Facility and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.38.2 Each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your Initial Advance Offer  unless the conditions set out in Section 38.7 are met in respect  of that partial repayment. Section 38.7 does not apply if you  are making Monthly Payments and so any partial repayment  you choose to make whilst making Monthly Payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an Early Repayment Charge. 38.3 We will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the Amount Owed to a value that is less than (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) the minimum Initial Advance as set out in your Initial Advance Offer. This does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the Property.38.4 If there is any partial repayment it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately. If you have more than one Advance, or Costs and Fees have been added to the Amount Owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your Advances, and the Costs and Fees that have been added (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 If you are making Monthly Payments, as detailed within Section 10, then Section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge if those repayments are within the Early Repayment Period.38.6 Partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the Advance without being subject to an  Early Repayment Charge provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:38Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Any partial repayment will be allocated between Advances and any Fees and Costs in proportion to the Advance and Fees and Costs when  compared to the Amount Owed. The partial repayment will  be allocated between capital and interest. This split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and  the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest).b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in Section 38.6, an Early Repayment Charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the Early Repayment Period. This charge could be zero . If this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. If the Early Repayment Charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.39. Early Repayment ChargesIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early.We offer a two different Early Repayment Charge options; Variable and Fixed. The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your Offer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime Mortgage. Further details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash examples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each Additional Advance Offer.

Fees and Costs may be applied to the Advance and these will increase the Amount Owed. Please refer to the Definitions section for details on when Fees and Costs may be applied. The Early Repayment Charge will be applied to the total Amount Owed. 39.2 A maximum Early Repayment Charge will apply to your Initial Advance and will be shown in your Initial Advance Offer A maximum Early Repayment Charge will also apply to each Additional Advance and will be shown in each Additional  Advance Offer 39.3 If you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.Variable Early Repayment Charge 39.4 The Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining Early Repayment Period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use Benchmark Interest Rates to take account of these movements). The way we calculate the Variable Early Repayment Charge is set out in your Offer. We have set out a worked example of how the Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated in the Early Repayment Charge guide.Fixed Early Repayment Charge 39.5 The Fixed Early Repayment Charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid.  The amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest.  The Early Repayment Charge percentage will reduce throughout the Early Repayment Period.  After the end of the Early Repayment Period, an Early Repayment Charge will not be payable. The Fixed Early Repayment Charge structure and a worked example is set out in your Offer and our Early Repayment Charge Guide40. Benchmark Interest Rates (applicable to the Variable Early Repayment Charge only)The Variable Early Repayment Charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use \u201cBenchmark Interest Rates\u201d to take account of these movements. For this, we use the UK FTSE 15 Year Gilt Yield Index. This Index is published daily in The Financial Times (under \u201cGilts \u2013 UK FTSE Actuaries Indices\u201d, \u201cYield Indices\u201d, \u201c15 yrs\u201d). For each Advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the Offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. Your Offer will show the Benchmark Interest Rate and the Target Benchmark Interest Rate for the Advance.40.1 On any Business Day, we use the Benchmark Interest Rate published on the previous Business Day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the Business Day before that.40Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

What is a breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement? If you fail to do something you agreed to do, for example insuring and maintaining the Property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the Property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement. This section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement.If there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage Agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home.42.1 If you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage Agreement then this is a breach.42.2 If a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. We will allow you a reasonable time to do so. We will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the Property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender.42.3 If you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the Property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. For example, this may require us to enter the Property and carry out repairs.42.4 If we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask,  we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply  to those Costs.42.5 Where we have to take action or incur Costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of Costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement (whether or not we add Costs to the Amount Owed because you have not paid them).42.6 If you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee.

This means if the Property is located in England or Wales, the competent court will be the courts of England and Wales. If the Property is located in Scotland, the competent court will be the Scottish courts. If the Property is located in Northern Ireland, the competent court will be the courts in Northern Ireland.52.5 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way.52.6 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are not consistent with anything in an Offer, the terms of the Offer will apply.53.

Variations for Properties in Scotland Due to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland then this section will apply to you.55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If the Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. In Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy.55.2 Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, this means a standard security under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security.55.3 In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are references to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for a house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that they do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d means owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property under a lease.5455Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will see reference to a court judgement in Section 9.7.55.5 Section 15 refers to occupiers.  In Scotland, if the occupier is  your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the Property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have.55.6 Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives.55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.55.8 If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into possession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  sell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 Act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 Act.55.9 There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section 45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.55.10 5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver.55.11 We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. We may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. You will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs. If the Property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. If we sell the Property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. If we sell the Property and the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You are required to explain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.  The provider will not complete the transaction until they have received a Certificate which has been signed and completed by both you and your client(s), whereby you confirm that you have drawn your client\u2019s(s\u2019) attention to the risks of entering into an equity release transaction and your client(s) confirms that he/they has/have been given the advice set out in the Certificate.Guidance on Independence Clients must use a legal adviser who is independent of the provider\u2019s solicitor.  If you are advising a client in relation to an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent of the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013 \u00b7the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or Wales); or\u00b7the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\u00b7the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of Scotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which take place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s Rules & GuidancePayment of Fees Whilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to this guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients to you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to you.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not be calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.This also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected with the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative or marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel membership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of staff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision or purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).  For the avoidance of doubt, certain marketing payments which are not connected with payment on a case-by-case basis are permitted, subject to the regulatory obligations of the parties concerned. You must inform your client(s) in writing of the amount and frequency of any financial arrangement, including marketing contributions, when issuing the customer case documentation at the outset.If the customer chooses not to instruct their own legal adviser, the adviser or provider (as appropriate) may offer the name of at least one local law firm which has knowledge of equity release products.  The adviser or provider must ensure that no pressure or financial inducement is involved in directing customers to any particular law firm either by them or the intermediaries recommending their products.Receipt of Payments If you are acting on behalf of the client you may not receive payments or other consideration from the adviser or provider if that payment is dependent on the completion of an equity release transaction. \f"}

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in some instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.You do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as described in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently leave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before this time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, Mortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents.1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority:a) your Offer Pack;b) Tariff of Charges;c) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; andd)  Mortgage Deed.2. Your Cash Facility2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The amount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.3. Your Initial Advance3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an amount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial Advance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Additional AdvancesYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your most recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. If you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to this Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer.4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The amount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your Initial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to the value of the Unused Cash Facility. 4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional Advance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the Interest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that will apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable to the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your acceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of the Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your Additional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  bank account.4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  secured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5. Your Unused Cash Facility5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any Additional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each time you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the Amount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee for your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not affect the Unused Cash Facility.5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your Unused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional Advance Offer.45Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  Additional AdvancesThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an Additional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have not used all of your Cash Facility. 6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you:a) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the Maximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage Agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; d) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the Property), and either party has died; e) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  Section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the Additional Advance;org) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section 29.2 for more details of this restriction).6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional Advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  to provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does not Complete.6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to value the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will refund the Valuation Fee to you.6Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Increasing your Cash FacilityWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing.  You can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this section. You will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement. If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional  Advance Offer.7.2 If we agree to increase your Cash Facility, you will be able to take an Additional Advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new Unused Cash Facility. After you have taken the Additional Advance up to the full amount of your Unused Cash Facility, the Unused Cash Facility will be zero.7.3 If you decide to request an increase to your Cash Facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated Fees. Your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice.  7.4 If we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. Your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for  their advice.7.5 We may obtain a new valuation of the Property from an independent, qualified Valuer. If we do, you will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. 7.6 If you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your Cash Facility. Also, to be eligible for an increase in your Cash Facility, you and the Property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your Cash Facility.7Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The Property as securityYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional Advances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime.8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have signed and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the Property at the Land Registry.8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose.8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else.9. InterestThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these Monthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). 9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. The Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or lower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  an Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  time we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance. 98Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If an Offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new Offer, the Interest Rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new Offer and is shown in your new Offer.9.4 The Interest Rate on any Fees or Costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the Fees or Costs are added. You will be notified of the Interest Rate applicable to such Fees and Costs at the time they are added. The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 Interest is charged daily at the Interest Rate on each amount which forms part of the Amount Owed, from the date that amount is added to the Amount Owed, until the date the Amount Owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in Section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 The interest that is charged daily forms part of the Amount Owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged:a) for Advances, from the date the relevant Advance Completes; or b) for any other amount (including Fees and Costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the Amount Owed.Each month, the interest that is charged daily is \u2018rolled-up\u2019, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.9.7 Interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the Amount Owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before.9.8 A lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the Amount Owed.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Monthly paymentsAs part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make Monthly Payments against the amount of interest charged. The amount of your ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  Once your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop making your Monthly Payments altogether.  If you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the Monthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-up\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making Monthly Payments they cannot be restarted. This Section explains more about your options.10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance you can select to make Monthly Payments.10.2 For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum of \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.10.3 For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly Payments on your Initial Advance.10.4 The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the Advance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.10.5 Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month.10.6 Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your Monthly Payments. 10.7 You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to giving us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. The Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term.10.8 You may request one Payment Holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following Completion of the Initial Advance, providing you give us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Interest not paid during a Payment Holiday will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will \u2018roll up\u2019 on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage.10.9 If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment for any month within 3 working days of the next Monthly Payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments and you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

This section tells you more about Fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the Fees will be.11.1 The Fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these Fees are payable are described in your Initial Advance Offer.11.2 The Fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an Additional Advance and when these Fees are payable are described in each Additional Advance Offer.11.3 Other Fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the Tariff of Charges.  From time to time, we may review the Fees that we charge and we may add new Fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect :11.3.1  a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services;  or11.3.2  any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take  account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. Any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change  on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business.11.4 If we change the Fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new Tariff of Charges.12. Costs that you may need to pay During your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. You may also need to pay Costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. Throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical Costs that may arise.12.1 You must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement.12.3 Where we add Fees or Costs to the Amount Owed, they will be treated in the same way as Advances for the purposes of charging interest and Early Repayment Charges, determining how much of your Unused Cash Facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the Amount Owed.13. The term of your lifetime mortgage13.1 Your Offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. The term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. Your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage Agreement continues to apply until the Amount Owed is repaid in full.14. Special ConditionsIn some instances we may need to apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage. These Special Conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the Property as recommended by the Valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  14.1 We may apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these Special Conditions are set out in your Offer.  Special Conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage Agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve  the conflict.14.2 We may ask you to satisfy Special Conditions before your lifetime mortgage Completes. Where Special Conditions require you to take some action in relation to the Property after your lifetime mortgage Completes you will have 6 months from the date of Completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing.14.3 We may require you to provide documents to confirm that a Special Condition in relation to the Property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the Property.

Insuring the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we want to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a mortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.25.1 You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you will not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if the Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. In that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it.25.2 The insurance policy must:a) be with a reputable insurer;b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to cover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the Property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  pay for alternative accommodation;c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  other index as we reasonably require;d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require;e) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the Advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  is the earliest; andf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two Business Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.25.3 Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy.25.5 You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  to date.25Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If we insure the Property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. You will need to pay the Costs that we incur in insuring the Property. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs.25.8 You can ask us for details of any insurance we have put in place  in respect of the Property.26.

If there has been significant loss or damage to the Property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us.27. Maintaining the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the Property. We will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the Property to a standard that exceeds the condition at the time we valued the Property, unless your Offer was subject to Special Conditions requiring repairs or other work to be carried out.27.1 During your lifetime mortgage you must maintain the Property  in good condition and repair and replace fixtures and fittings  when necessary.27.2 You must carry out any repairs or other works required by us  as a condition of your Offer by the date set by us.

Making changes to the Property You must tell us if you wish to alter the Property. We will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the Property, but we have put in place safeguards. These safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the Property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard.28.1 You must not alter the Property structurally, extend or convert the Property or change the use of the Property unless you have our written permission to do so.

You must ensure that any obligations concerning the Property, including under the planning permission and in your title deeds, are complied with.28.3 All building works must be carried out to an acceptable standard by appropriate qualified contractors. We may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to inspect the completed works and you will need to pay a non-refundable Fee for this.29. Other secured borrowingYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the Property.

Repayment on death and Long Term CareYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. This section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. We recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event.You might also need to repay early if there is a Default Event, which is described in Section 43 of this booklet.35.1 You can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. The Amount Owed, including all of the interest, Fees and Costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the Property, although the Amount Owed can be repaid from other funds.35.2 A \u201cRepayment Event\u201d will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care.

No negative equity guaranteeYour lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity guarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount Owed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.36.1 You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. If we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might be less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment Charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.36.2 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale Proceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms of Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee.36.3 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough to cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  Amount Owed.36.4 In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably believe that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, we may spend money on the Property in order to make it more marketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the Property. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged. We will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). We will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the Property is sold. If we are unable to sell the Property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the Property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 If you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the Property has been reduced, and/or the Amount Owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the Sale Proceeds being less than the Amount Owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Early repaymentYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care.If you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, and repayment of an Advance happens during the Early Repayment Period which is set out in the Offer for that Advance, you may have to pay a substantial Early Repayment Charge when you repay. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a Repayment Event.If you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.You should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.37.1 If you repay all or part of the Amount Owed before a Repayment Event as explained in Section 35 (which explains when a Repayment Event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as set out in more detail below. Early Repayment Charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in Section 41.37.2 We require at least 14 days\u2019 written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. We will then calculate the Amount Owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any Early Repayment Charge due at that time).37.3 You can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the Amount Owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period.37.4 If the Amount Owed is repaid as a result of a Default Event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge may be payable.37Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Partial repaymentYou are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, subject to certain limits specified in the Offer Pack and as set out in Section 38.7 below, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge on any partial repayment that you make in excess of these limits. Making a partial repayment will not increase your Unused Cash Facility, but may reduce your Cash Facility.If you are making Monthly Payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge and Section 38.7 will not apply.You should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.38.1 If there is any repayment of part of the Amount Owed, we may reduce your Cash Facility and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.38.2 Each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your Initial Advance Offer  unless the conditions set out in Section 38.7 are met in respect  of that partial repayment. Section 38.7 does not apply if you  are making Monthly Payments and so any partial repayment  you choose to make whilst making Monthly Payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an Early Repayment Charge. 38.3 We will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the Amount Owed to a value that is less than (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) the minimum Initial Advance as set out in your Initial Advance Offer. This does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the Property.38.4 If there is any partial repayment it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately. If you have more than one Advance, or Costs and Fees have been added to the Amount Owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your Advances, and the Costs and Fees that have been added (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 If you are making Monthly Payments, as detailed within Section 10, then Section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge if those repayments are within the Early Repayment Period.38.6 Partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the Advance without being subject to an  Early Repayment Charge provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:38Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Any partial repayment will be allocated between Advances and any Fees and Costs in proportion to the Advance and Fees and Costs when  compared to the Amount Owed. The partial repayment will  be allocated between capital and interest. This split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and  the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest).b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in Section 38.6, an Early Repayment Charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the Early Repayment Period. This charge could be zero . If this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. If the Early Repayment Charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.39. Early Repayment ChargesIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early.We offer a two different Early Repayment Charge options; Variable and Fixed. The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your Offer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime Mortgage. Further details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash examples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each Additional Advance Offer.

Fees and Costs may be applied to the Advance and these will increase the Amount Owed. Please refer to the Definitions section for details on when Fees and Costs may be applied. The Early Repayment Charge will be applied to the total Amount Owed. 39.2 A maximum Early Repayment Charge will apply to your Initial Advance and will be shown in your Initial Advance Offer A maximum Early Repayment Charge will also apply to each Additional Advance and will be shown in each Additional  Advance Offer 39.3 If you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.Variable Early Repayment Charge 39.4 The Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining Early Repayment Period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use Benchmark Interest Rates to take account of these movements). The way we calculate the Variable Early Repayment Charge is set out in your Offer. We have set out a worked example of how the Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated in the Early Repayment Charge guide.Fixed Early Repayment Charge 39.5 The Fixed Early Repayment Charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid.  The amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest.  The Early Repayment Charge percentage will reduce throughout the Early Repayment Period.  After the end of the Early Repayment Period, an Early Repayment Charge will not be payable. The Fixed Early Repayment Charge structure and a worked example is set out in your Offer and our Early Repayment Charge Guide40. Benchmark Interest Rates (applicable to the Variable Early Repayment Charge only)The Variable Early Repayment Charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use \u201cBenchmark Interest Rates\u201d to take account of these movements. For this, we use the UK FTSE 15 Year Gilt Yield Index. This Index is published daily in The Financial Times (under \u201cGilts \u2013 UK FTSE Actuaries Indices\u201d, \u201cYield Indices\u201d, \u201c15 yrs\u201d). For each Advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the Offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. Your Offer will show the Benchmark Interest Rate and the Target Benchmark Interest Rate for the Advance.40.1 On any Business Day, we use the Benchmark Interest Rate published on the previous Business Day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the Business Day before that.40Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

What is a breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement? If you fail to do something you agreed to do, for example insuring and maintaining the Property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the Property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement. This section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement.If there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage Agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home.42.1 If you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage Agreement then this is a breach.42.2 If a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. We will allow you a reasonable time to do so. We will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the Property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender.42.3 If you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the Property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. For example, this may require us to enter the Property and carry out repairs.42.4 If we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask,  we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply  to those Costs.42.5 Where we have to take action or incur Costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of Costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement (whether or not we add Costs to the Amount Owed because you have not paid them).42.6 If you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee.

Giving notice54.1 We will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters we send will be sent to you at the Property, unless you have given us another address to use.54.2 You must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters you send must be sent to Just Retirement Money Limited at the address in the \u2018About us\u2019 section, unless we have given you another address to use.55. Variations for Properties in Scotland Due to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland then this section will apply to you.55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If the Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. In Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy.55.2 Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, this means a standard security under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security.55.3 In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are references to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for a house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that they do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d means owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property under a lease.5455Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will see reference to a court judgement in Section 9.7.55.5 Section 15 refers to occupiers.  In Scotland, if the occupier is  your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the Property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have.55.6 Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives.55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.55.8 If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into possession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  sell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 Act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 Act.55.9 There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section 45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.55.10 5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver.55.11 We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. We may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. You will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs. If the Property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. If we sell the Property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. If we sell the Property and the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in some instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.You do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as described in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently leave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before this time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, Mortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents.1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority:a) your Offer Pack;b) Tariff of Charges;c) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; andd)  Mortgage Deed.2.

Additional AdvancesYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your most recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. If you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to this Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer.4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The amount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your Initial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to the value of the Unused Cash Facility. 4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional Advance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the Interest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that will apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable to the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your acceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of the Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your Additional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  bank account.4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  secured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5. Your Unused Cash Facility5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any Additional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each time you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the Amount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee for your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not affect the Unused Cash Facility.5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your Unused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional Advance Offer.45Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  Additional AdvancesThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an Additional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have not used all of your Cash Facility. 6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you:a) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the Maximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage Agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; d) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the Property), and either party has died; e) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  Section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the Additional Advance;org) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section 29.2 for more details of this restriction).6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional Advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  to provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does not Complete.6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to value the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will refund the Valuation Fee to you.6Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Increasing your Cash FacilityWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing.  You can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this section. You will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement. If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional  Advance Offer.7.2 If we agree to increase your Cash Facility, you will be able to take an Additional Advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new Unused Cash Facility. After you have taken the Additional Advance up to the full amount of your Unused Cash Facility, the Unused Cash Facility will be zero.7.3 If you decide to request an increase to your Cash Facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated Fees.

The Property as securityYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional Advances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime.8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have signed and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the Property at the Land Registry.8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose.8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else.9. InterestThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these Monthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). 9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. The Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or lower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  an Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  time we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance. 98Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If an Offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new Offer, the Interest Rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new Offer and is shown in your new Offer.9.4 The Interest Rate on any Fees or Costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the Fees or Costs are added. You will be notified of the Interest Rate applicable to such Fees and Costs at the time they are added. The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 Interest is charged daily at the Interest Rate on each amount which forms part of the Amount Owed, from the date that amount is added to the Amount Owed, until the date the Amount Owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in Section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 The interest that is charged daily forms part of the Amount Owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged:a) for Advances, from the date the relevant Advance Completes; or b) for any other amount (including Fees and Costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the Amount Owed.Each month, the interest that is charged daily is \u2018rolled-up\u2019, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.9.7 Interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the Amount Owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before.9.8 A lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the Amount Owed.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Monthly paymentsAs part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make Monthly Payments against the amount of interest charged. The amount of your ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  Once your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop making your Monthly Payments altogether.  If you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the Monthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-up\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making Monthly Payments they cannot be restarted. This Section explains more about your options.10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance you can select to make Monthly Payments.10.2 For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum of \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.10.3 For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly Payments on your Initial Advance.10.4 The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the Advance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.10.5 Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month.10.6 Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your Monthly Payments. 10.7 You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to giving us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. The Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term.10.8 You may request one Payment Holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following Completion of the Initial Advance, providing you give us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Interest not paid during a Payment Holiday will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will \u2018roll up\u2019 on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage.10.9 If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment for any month within 3 working days of the next Monthly Payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments and you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Costs that you may need to pay During your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others.

These Special Conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the Property as recommended by the Valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  14.1 We may apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these Special Conditions are set out in your Offer.  Special Conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage Agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve  the conflict.14.2 We may ask you to satisfy Special Conditions before your lifetime mortgage Completes.

Insuring the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we want to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a mortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.25.1 You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you will not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if the Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. In that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it.25.2 The insurance policy must:a) be with a reputable insurer;b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to cover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the Property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  pay for alternative accommodation;c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  other index as we reasonably require;d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require;e) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the Advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  is the earliest; andf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two Business Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.25.3 Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy.25.5 You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  to date.25Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Repayment on death and Long Term CareYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. This section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. We recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event.You might also need to repay early if there is a Default Event, which is described in Section 43 of this booklet.35.1 You can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. The Amount Owed, including all of the interest, Fees and Costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the Property, although the Amount Owed can be repaid from other funds.35.2 A \u201cRepayment Event\u201d will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. The Amount Owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the Repayment Event. You must tell us as soon as possible in writing  if a Repayment Event occurs.  35.3 In the event of your death, your personal representative must notify us of this in writing and provide us with a death certificate and any other documentation that we reasonably require.35.4 If you permanently leave the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care, you must provide us with written confirmation from a suitably qualified doctor or other medical or care professional who is acceptable to us.

No negative equity guaranteeYour lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity guarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount Owed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.36.1 You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. If we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might be less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment Charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.36.2 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale Proceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms of Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee.36.3 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough to cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  Amount Owed.36.4 In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably believe that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, we may spend money on the Property in order to make it more marketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the Property. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged. We will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). We will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the Property is sold. If we are unable to sell the Property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the Property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 If you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the Property has been reduced, and/or the Amount Owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the Sale Proceeds being less than the Amount Owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as set out in more detail below. Early Repayment Charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in Section 41.37.2 We require at least 14 days\u2019 written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. We will then calculate the Amount Owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any Early Repayment Charge due at that time).37.3 You can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the Amount Owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period.37.4 If the Amount Owed is repaid as a result of a Default Event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge may be payable.37Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Making a partial repayment will not increase your Unused Cash Facility, but may reduce your Cash Facility.If you are making Monthly Payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge and Section 38.7 will not apply.You should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.38.1 If there is any repayment of part of the Amount Owed, we may reduce your Cash Facility and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.38.2 Each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your Initial Advance Offer  unless the conditions set out in Section 38.7 are met in respect  of that partial repayment. Section 38.7 does not apply if you  are making Monthly Payments and so any partial repayment  you choose to make whilst making Monthly Payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an Early Repayment Charge. 38.3 We will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the Amount Owed to a value that is less than (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) the minimum Initial Advance as set out in your Initial Advance Offer. This does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the Property.38.4 If there is any partial repayment it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately.

Any partial repayment will be allocated between Advances and any Fees and Costs in proportion to the Advance and Fees and Costs when  compared to the Amount Owed. The partial repayment will  be allocated between capital and interest. This split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and  the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest).b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in Section 38.6, an Early Repayment Charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the Early Repayment Period. This charge could be zero . If this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. If the Early Repayment Charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.39. Early Repayment ChargesIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term.

We have set out a worked example of how the Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated in the Early Repayment Charge guide.Fixed Early Repayment Charge 39.5 The Fixed Early Repayment Charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid.  The amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest.  The Early Repayment Charge percentage will reduce throughout the Early Repayment Period.  After the end of the Early Repayment Period, an Early Repayment Charge will not be payable. The Fixed Early Repayment Charge structure and a worked example is set out in your Offer and our Early Repayment Charge Guide40. Benchmark Interest Rates (applicable to the Variable Early Repayment Charge only)The Variable Early Repayment Charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use \u201cBenchmark Interest Rates\u201d to take account of these movements. For this, we use the UK FTSE 15 Year Gilt Yield Index. This Index is published daily in The Financial Times (under \u201cGilts \u2013 UK FTSE Actuaries Indices\u201d, \u201cYield Indices\u201d, \u201c15 yrs\u201d). For each Advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the Offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. Your Offer will show the Benchmark Interest Rate and the Target Benchmark Interest Rate for the Advance.40.1 On any Business Day, we use the Benchmark Interest Rate published on the previous Business Day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the Business Day before that.40Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

What is a breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement? If you fail to do something you agreed to do, for example insuring and maintaining the Property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the Property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement. This section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement.If there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage Agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home.42.1 If you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage Agreement then this is a breach.42.2 If a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. We will allow you a reasonable time to do so. We will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the Property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender.42.3 If you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the Property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. For example, this may require us to enter the Property and carry out repairs.42.4 If we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask,  we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply  to those Costs.42.5 Where we have to take action or incur Costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of Costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement (whether or not we add Costs to the Amount Owed because you have not paid them).42.6 If you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee.

What is a Default Event?A Default Event is an event that could lead to serious consequences: for example we could require you to repay the Amount Owed early or it could lead to possession and sale of the Property.

If you do not pay these when we ask you to, then these amounts will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged.45. Appointment of a property receiver Where a Default Event occurs we can appoint a receiver for all or part of the Property. The receiver will act as your agent and this means you are responsible for their costs and their actions. We, or the receiver, can do anything that you could do with the Property, such as signing documents to do with your lifetime mortgage Agreement or the Property. If your Property is in Scotland, we have rights under the standard security but these do not include appointing a receiver. We are entitled to exercise our rights and remedies ourselves. Please see Section 55.9.45.1 If a Default Event occurs, or if the Property or our security appears to be at risk (for example, another creditor takes enforcement action in respect of the Property), then we have the right to appoint a receiver. We can do this without giving you any prior notice. We can also remove the receiver and choose whether or not we need to appoint another one.45.2 None of the restrictions made by the Law of Property Act 1925 in relation to the appointment apply.45.3 Any receiver we appoint will be regarded as your agent and you will be responsible for the receiver\u2019s actions and omissions. The receiver can do anything in relation to the Property as if the receiver were absolutely entitled to it.4445Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The law that applies to your lifetime mortgageYour lifetime mortgage is governed by the laws set out below. Any disputes that arise out of, or in connection with your lifetime mortgage can be settled in a court of law as set out below.52.1 If the Property is in England or Wales, your lifetime mortgage Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.52.2 If the Property is in Scotland, your lifetime mortgage Agreement  is governed by the laws of Scotland.52.3 If the Property is in Northern Ireland, your lifetime mortgage Agreement is governed by the laws of Northern Ireland.52.4 The terms of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the United Kingdom in which the Property is located. This means if the Property is located in England or Wales, the competent court will be the courts of England and Wales. If the Property is located in Scotland, the competent court will be the Scottish courts. If the Property is located in Northern Ireland, the competent court will be the courts in Northern Ireland.52.5 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way.52.6 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are not consistent with anything in an Offer, the terms of the Offer will apply.53.

Giving notice54.1 We will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters we send will be sent to you at the Property, unless you have given us another address to use.54.2 You must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters you send must be sent to Just Retirement Money Limited at the address in the \u2018About us\u2019 section, unless we have given you another address to use.55. Variations for Properties in Scotland Due to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland then this section will apply to you.55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If the Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. In Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy.55.2 Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, this means a standard security under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security.55.3 In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are references to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for a house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that they do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d means owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property under a lease.5455Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will see reference to a court judgement in Section 9.7.55.5 Section 15 refers to occupiers.  In Scotland, if the occupier is  your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the Property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have.55.6 Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives.55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.55.8 If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into possession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  sell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 Act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 Act.55.9 There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section 45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.55.10 5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver.55.11 We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in some instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.You do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as described in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently leave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before this time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, Mortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents.1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority:a) your Offer Pack;b) Tariff of Charges;c) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; andd)  Mortgage Deed.2.

Your Initial Advance3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an amount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial Advance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Additional AdvancesYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your most recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. If you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to this Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer.4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The amount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your Initial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to the value of the Unused Cash Facility. 4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional Advance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the Interest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that will apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable to the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your acceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of the Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your Additional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  bank account.4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  secured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5. Your Unused Cash Facility5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any Additional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each time you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the Amount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee for your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not affect the Unused Cash Facility.5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your Unused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional Advance Offer.45Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  Additional AdvancesThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an Additional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have not used all of your Cash Facility. 6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you:a) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the Maximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage Agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; d) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the Property), and either party has died; e) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  Section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the Additional Advance;org) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section 29.2 for more details of this restriction).6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional Advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  to provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does not Complete.6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to value the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will refund the Valuation Fee to you.6Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Increasing your Cash FacilityWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing.  You can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this section. You will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement. If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional  Advance Offer.7.2 If we agree to increase your Cash Facility, you will be able to take an Additional Advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new Unused Cash Facility. After you have taken the Additional Advance up to the full amount of your Unused Cash Facility, the Unused Cash Facility will be zero.7.3 If you decide to request an increase to your Cash Facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated Fees. Your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice.  7.4 If we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. Your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for  their advice.7.5 We may obtain a new valuation of the Property from an independent, qualified Valuer. If we do, you will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. 7.6 If you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your Cash Facility. Also, to be eligible for an increase in your Cash Facility, you and the Property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your Cash Facility.7Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The Property as securityYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional Advances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime.8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have signed and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the Property at the Land Registry.8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose.8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else.9. InterestThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these Monthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). 9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. The Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or lower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  an Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  time we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance. 98Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If an Offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new Offer, the Interest Rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new Offer and is shown in your new Offer.9.4 The Interest Rate on any Fees or Costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the Fees or Costs are added. You will be notified of the Interest Rate applicable to such Fees and Costs at the time they are added. The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 Interest is charged daily at the Interest Rate on each amount which forms part of the Amount Owed, from the date that amount is added to the Amount Owed, until the date the Amount Owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in Section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 The interest that is charged daily forms part of the Amount Owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged:a) for Advances, from the date the relevant Advance Completes; or b) for any other amount (including Fees and Costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the Amount Owed.Each month, the interest that is charged daily is \u2018rolled-up\u2019, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.9.7 Interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the Amount Owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before.9.8 A lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the Amount Owed.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Monthly paymentsAs part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make Monthly Payments against the amount of interest charged. The amount of your ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  Once your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop making your Monthly Payments altogether.  If you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the Monthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-up\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making Monthly Payments they cannot be restarted. This Section explains more about your options.10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance you can select to make Monthly Payments.10.2 For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum of \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.10.3 For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly Payments on your Initial Advance.10.4 The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the Advance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.10.5 Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month.10.6 Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your Monthly Payments. 10.7 You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to giving us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. The Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term.10.8 You may request one Payment Holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following Completion of the Initial Advance, providing you give us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Interest not paid during a Payment Holiday will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will \u2018roll up\u2019 on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage.10.9 If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment for any month within 3 working days of the next Monthly Payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments and you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Fees that you may need to pay Throughout this booklet we refer to Fees that you may need to pay to us.

Any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change  on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business.11.4 If we change the Fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new Tariff of Charges.12. Costs that you may need to pay During your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others.

The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement.12.3 Where we add Fees or Costs to the Amount Owed, they will be treated in the same way as Advances for the purposes of charging interest and Early Repayment Charges, determining how much of your Unused Cash Facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the Amount Owed.13. The term of your lifetime mortgage13.1 Your Offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. The term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. Your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage Agreement continues to apply until the Amount Owed is repaid in full.14. Special ConditionsIn some instances we may need to apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage. These Special Conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the Property as recommended by the Valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  14.1 We may apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these Special Conditions are set out in your Offer.  Special Conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage Agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve  the conflict.14.2 We may ask you to satisfy Special Conditions before your lifetime mortgage Completes. Where Special Conditions require you to take some action in relation to the Property after your lifetime mortgage Completes you will have 6 months from the date of Completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing.14.3 We may require you to provide documents to confirm that a Special Condition in relation to the Property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the Property.

Insuring the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we want to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a mortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.25.1 You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you will not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if the Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. In that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it.25.2 The insurance policy must:a) be with a reputable insurer;b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to cover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the Property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  pay for alternative accommodation;c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  other index as we reasonably require;d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require;e) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the Advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  is the earliest; andf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two Business Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.25.3 Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy.25.5 You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  to date.25Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If we insure the Property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. You will need to pay the Costs that we incur in insuring the Property. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs.25.8 You can ask us for details of any insurance we have put in place  in respect of the Property.26.

If there has been significant loss or damage to the Property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us.27. Maintaining the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the Property. We will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the Property to a standard that exceeds the condition at the time we valued the Property, unless your Offer was subject to Special Conditions requiring repairs or other work to be carried out.27.1 During your lifetime mortgage you must maintain the Property  in good condition and repair and replace fixtures and fittings  when necessary.27.2 You must carry out any repairs or other works required by us  as a condition of your Offer by the date set by us.

Making changes to the Property You must tell us if you wish to alter the Property. We will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the Property, but we have put in place safeguards. These safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the Property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard.28.1 You must not alter the Property structurally, extend or convert the Property or change the use of the Property unless you have our written permission to do so. You will be responsible for paying for the cost of preparing any plans or reports required by us, and all the expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not  give permission.28.2 You must obtain all necessary planning permission and building regulations approval for the Property. You must ensure that any obligations concerning the Property, including under the planning permission and in your title deeds, are complied with.28.3 All building works must be carried out to an acceptable standard by appropriate qualified contractors. We may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to inspect the completed works and you will need to pay a non-refundable Fee for this.29. Other secured borrowingYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the Property. Other lenders may not be willing to lend to you because we have a first charge on the Property and the Amount Owed will increase due to the roll-up of interest.2928Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Repayment on death and Long Term CareYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. This section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. We recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event.You might also need to repay early if there is a Default Event, which is described in Section 43 of this booklet.35.1 You can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. The Amount Owed, including all of the interest, Fees and Costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the Property, although the Amount Owed can be repaid from other funds.35.2 A \u201cRepayment Event\u201d will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. The Amount Owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the Repayment Event. You must tell us as soon as possible in writing  if a Repayment Event occurs.  35.3 In the event of your death, your personal representative must notify us of this in writing and provide us with a death certificate and any other documentation that we reasonably require.35.4 If you permanently leave the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care, you must provide us with written confirmation from a suitably qualified doctor or other medical or care professional who is acceptable to us. This confirmation must be in the form we reasonably require, and must confirm that you require Long Term Care and provide details of the Long Term Care arrangements. You should provide us with this confirmation before you leave the Property so that we can confirm whether this would be an early repayment and whether an Early Repayment Charge may  be payable.35.5 If the information provided in the written confirmation is not reasonably satisfactory to us, or is not provided before your lifetime mortgage is repaid, then payment of the Amount Owed will be regarded as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge will be payable if the payment is within the Early Repayment period.35.6 Following a Repayment Event, you (or your personal representatives in the event of your death) must, without delay, take all reasonable steps to market the Property for sale and to negotiate the best possible price reasonably obtainable for the Property.

No negative equity guaranteeYour lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity guarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount Owed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.36.1 You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. If we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might be less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment Charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.36.2 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale Proceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms of Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee.36.3 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough to cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  Amount Owed.36.4 In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably believe that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, we may spend money on the Property in order to make it more marketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the Property. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged. We will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). We will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the Property is sold. If we are unable to sell the Property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the Property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 If you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the Property has been reduced, and/or the Amount Owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the Sale Proceeds being less than the Amount Owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a Repayment Event.If you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.You should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.37.1 If you repay all or part of the Amount Owed before a Repayment Event as explained in Section 35 (which explains when a Repayment Event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as set out in more detail below. Early Repayment Charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in Section 41.37.2 We require at least 14 days\u2019 written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. We will then calculate the Amount Owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any Early Repayment Charge due at that time).37.3 You can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the Amount Owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period.37.4 If the Amount Owed is repaid as a result of a Default Event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge may be payable.37Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Partial repaymentYou are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, subject to certain limits specified in the Offer Pack and as set out in Section 38.7 below, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge on any partial repayment that you make in excess of these limits. Making a partial repayment will not increase your Unused Cash Facility, but may reduce your Cash Facility.If you are making Monthly Payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge and Section 38.7 will not apply.You should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.38.1 If there is any repayment of part of the Amount Owed, we may reduce your Cash Facility and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.38.2 Each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your Initial Advance Offer  unless the conditions set out in Section 38.7 are met in respect  of that partial repayment. Section 38.7 does not apply if you  are making Monthly Payments and so any partial repayment  you choose to make whilst making Monthly Payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an Early Repayment Charge. 38.3 We will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the Amount Owed to a value that is less than (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) the minimum Initial Advance as set out in your Initial Advance Offer. This does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the Property.38.4 If there is any partial repayment it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately. If you have more than one Advance, or Costs and Fees have been added to the Amount Owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your Advances, and the Costs and Fees that have been added (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 If you are making Monthly Payments, as detailed within Section 10, then Section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge if those repayments are within the Early Repayment Period.38.6 Partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the Advance without being subject to an  Early Repayment Charge provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:38Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Any partial repayment will be allocated between Advances and any Fees and Costs in proportion to the Advance and Fees and Costs when  compared to the Amount Owed. The partial repayment will  be allocated between capital and interest. This split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and  the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest).b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in Section 38.6, an Early Repayment Charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the Early Repayment Period. This charge could be zero . If this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. If the Early Repayment Charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.39. Early Repayment ChargesIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early.We offer a two different Early Repayment Charge options; Variable and Fixed. The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your Offer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime Mortgage. Further details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash examples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each Additional Advance Offer.

The Early Repayment Charge will be applied to the total Amount Owed. 39.2 A maximum Early Repayment Charge will apply to your Initial Advance and will be shown in your Initial Advance Offer A maximum Early Repayment Charge will also apply to each Additional Advance and will be shown in each Additional  Advance Offer 39.3 If you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.Variable Early Repayment Charge 39.4 The Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining Early Repayment Period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use Benchmark Interest Rates to take account of these movements). The way we calculate the Variable Early Repayment Charge is set out in your Offer. We have set out a worked example of how the Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated in the Early Repayment Charge guide.Fixed Early Repayment Charge 39.5 The Fixed Early Repayment Charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid.  The amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest.  The Early Repayment Charge percentage will reduce throughout the Early Repayment Period.  After the end of the Early Repayment Period, an Early Repayment Charge will not be payable. The Fixed Early Repayment Charge structure and a worked example is set out in your Offer and our Early Repayment Charge Guide40. Benchmark Interest Rates (applicable to the Variable Early Repayment Charge only)The Variable Early Repayment Charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use \u201cBenchmark Interest Rates\u201d to take account of these movements. For this, we use the UK FTSE 15 Year Gilt Yield Index. This Index is published daily in The Financial Times (under \u201cGilts \u2013 UK FTSE Actuaries Indices\u201d, \u201cYield Indices\u201d, \u201c15 yrs\u201d). For each Advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the Offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. Your Offer will show the Benchmark Interest Rate and the Target Benchmark Interest Rate for the Advance.40.1 On any Business Day, we use the Benchmark Interest Rate published on the previous Business Day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the Business Day before that.40Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

What is a breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement? If you fail to do something you agreed to do, for example insuring and maintaining the Property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the Property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement.

We will allow you a reasonable time to do so. We will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the Property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender.42.3 If you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the Property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. For example, this may require us to enter the Property and carry out repairs.42.4 If we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask,  we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply  to those Costs.42.5 Where we have to take action or incur Costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of Costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement (whether or not we add Costs to the Amount Owed because you have not paid them).42.6 If you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee.

We, or the receiver, can do anything that you could do with the Property, such as signing documents to do with your lifetime mortgage Agreement or the Property. If your Property is in Scotland, we have rights under the standard security but these do not include appointing a receiver. We are entitled to exercise our rights and remedies ourselves. Please see Section 55.9.45.1 If a Default Event occurs, or if the Property or our security appears to be at risk (for example, another creditor takes enforcement action in respect of the Property), then we have the right to appoint a receiver. We can do this without giving you any prior notice. We can also remove the receiver and choose whether or not we need to appoint another one.45.2 None of the restrictions made by the Law of Property Act 1925 in relation to the appointment apply.45.3 Any receiver we appoint will be regarded as your agent and you will be responsible for the receiver\u2019s actions and omissions. The receiver can do anything in relation to the Property as if the receiver were absolutely entitled to it.4445Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Powers to sell the PropertyThis section details what happens when we or a receiver have to sell the Property. There are some additions and qualifications to these provisions in relation to a Property in Scotland. Please see Section 55.11.46.1 We have the power of sale, and other powers from Section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925, over the Property as part of your lifetime mortgage.  For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs.46.2 Section 103 of the Law of Property Act 1925 will not apply to your lifetime mortgage.  (Section 103 would otherwise restrict our powers of sale.) For example, we are not required to give you three months\u2019 notice before we sell the Property.46.3 If we, or the receiver take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a mortgage lender in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property.46.4 If we, or the receiver, have to sell the Property, we or the receiver may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. We may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. You will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs.46.5 If the Property is sold by us, or by a receiver appointed by us, it  can be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us by a lump sum,  in instalments or a partial payment.46.6 If we, or the receiver, sell the Property we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw any contract for sale.46.7 If we, or the receiver sell the Property and the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, assuming there is no-one with  a prior right, anything left over will be given to you, for the benefit  of you or your beneficiaries.General conditionsThis section includes other general conditions that apply to your  lifetime mortgage.47. Power of Attorney47.1 For the purpose of securing our interest in the Property, by signing the Mortgage Deed you appoint us and any receiver appointed by us to be your attorney. As your attorney we (or the receiver) will be entitled to do things you are obliged to do under these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions on your behalf, and our acts will bind you as though you had done them yourself. 47.2 You can\u2019t cancel these appointments until all the money secured  by the mortgage security is paid off. 4746Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Joint and several liability48.1 If you have borrowed on your own you are fully responsible  to pay the Amount Owed and to comply with your lifetime mortgage Agreement.48.2 If you have borrowed jointly then your lifetime mortgage Agreement applies to both of you together and each of you separately. This means that each of you can be individually held fully responsible for complying with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and paying the Amount Owed.49. Rights of third parties49.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement can only be enforced by you, your successors, your personal representatives and us, our successors and any person or company to whom we transfer or assign all or part of our rights under your lifetime mortgage Agreement (which includes your lifetime mortgage).49.2 Your personal representatives and successors will be bound  by your lifetime mortgage Agreement after your death.50. Payments50.1 Whenever you make a payment to us it should always be made during normal banking hours in sterling and come from you to us immediately. If a date for paying us falls on a non-Business Day then the payment should be made on the next Business Day.50.2 All payments to us must be made without set-off and without any deduction on account of any tax, duty or other charge, unless a deduction is required by law. If a deduction is required by law, you will increase the payment so that we receive the amount due to us before the deduction.51. Transfer of your lifetime mortgage51.1 We may transfer (including by declaration of trust), assign or charge all or part of our rights under your lifetime mortgage Agreement (which includes your lifetime mortgage) to another person or company at any time.51.2 If we do this the person or company who takes over the rights we transfer will have the same rights as we have. Your rights and obligations will not be affected by this, and the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement will not change because of this.51.3 We may delegate all or part of our rights and obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement to another person or company at any time.51.4 We may pass on details about you and your lifetime mortgage Agreement to another person or company where we consider it necessary or advisable to do so in connection with any sale or financing arrangement which we may enter into or consider in connection with your lifetime mortgage.51.5 Before we legally assign your lifetime mortgage we will write to  tell you.51.6 You may not transfer, assign or charge all or part of your rights under your lifetime mortgage Agreement to anyone else.48495051Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The law that applies to your lifetime mortgageYour lifetime mortgage is governed by the laws set out below. Any disputes that arise out of, or in connection with your lifetime mortgage can be settled in a court of law as set out below.52.1 If the Property is in England or Wales, your lifetime mortgage Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.52.2 If the Property is in Scotland, your lifetime mortgage Agreement  is governed by the laws of Scotland.52.3 If the Property is in Northern Ireland, your lifetime mortgage Agreement is governed by the laws of Northern Ireland.52.4 The terms of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the United Kingdom in which the Property is located. This means if the Property is located in England or Wales, the competent court will be the courts of England and Wales. If the Property is located in Scotland, the competent court will be the Scottish courts. If the Property is located in Northern Ireland, the competent court will be the courts in Northern Ireland.52.5 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way.52.6 If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement are not consistent with anything in an Offer, the terms of the Offer will apply.53. Changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement53.1 We can make reasonable changes to your lifetime mortgage Agreement in the following circumstances:a) to make the terms of the lifetime mortgage Agreement easier to understand or fairer to you; b) to reflect an improvement of any service or facility we supply  in connection with your mortgage; c) to introduce a new service; d) to replace an existing service with a new one (but only where this would not be to your disadvantage);e) to correct any obvious error that might be found in the  future in relation to the written terms of the lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5352Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Giving notice54.1 We will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters we send will be sent to you at the Property, unless you have given us another address to use.54.2 You must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters you send must be sent to Just Retirement Money Limited at the address in the \u2018About us\u2019 section, unless we have given you another address to use.55. Variations for Properties in Scotland Due to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland then this section will apply to you.55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If the Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. In Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy.55.2 Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, this means a standard security under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security.55.3 In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are references to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for a house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that they do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d means owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property under a lease.5455Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will see reference to a court judgement in Section 9.7.55.5 Section 15 refers to occupiers.  In Scotland, if the occupier is  your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the Property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have.55.6 Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives.55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.55.8 If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into possession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  sell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 Act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 Act.55.9 There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section 45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.55.10 5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver.55.11 We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. We may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. You will need to pay any Costs we incur.

If the lifetime mortgage doesn\u2019t complete by 10 January 2023, we may cancel the offer.   This offer replaces any previous offer you may have received from us.  Accepting the offer To go ahead and accept this offer, contact your legal adviser who will take you through the relevant documents. Of course, you don\u2019t have to accept our offer, but we can\u2019t refund any fees paid if you don't. You can find out more about fees in Section 11 of the offer.  Once you accept the offer and we pay the initial advance to your legal adviser, the contract is in force. That means you can't change your mind. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, but there may be an early repayment charge. Learn more about early repayment charges in Section 13 of the Offer Document. The guide enclosed also includes helpful information about early repayment charges.  Instructing your legal adviser It\u2019s important for your own protection that you take independent legal advice. Your legal adviser will explain the legal implications of your lifetime mortgage agreement and the terms of this offer. They\u2019ll also answer any questions you might have.  If your legal adviser needs something in writing before acting on your behalf, we\u2019ve included a letter you can sign and give to them.

However, you are still the owner of the property.   \f"}

We also need to be satisfied with the title to the property (who owns it legally) and that you meet any special conditions in this offer. Most properties are now registered at the land registry. However, we believe the Property is currently unregistered. Our legal advisers will need your title deeds to register the Property at the land registry. Please provide the title deeds to your legal adviser as soon as possible to avoid any delays.  Buildings insurance You must have suitable buildings insurance cover. This should cover at least the rebuilding cost of the property of \u00a3385,000.00. If the sum insured is below this amount, you should speak to your insurer to increase it. Your legal adviser will need to see the original buildings insurance policy schedule.  Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the buildings insurance policy. We can ask for cover as joint insured or co-insured on a \u2018composite\u2019 basis. \u2018Composite\u2019 insurance is another way of covering more than one person under an insurance policy.  Your legal adviser can explain the difference and may also arrange this for you.  Your initial advance When your lifetime mortgage completes, we will pay the initial advance to your legal adviser. Remember, legal advisers may take off legal fees or disbursements (payments for things like writing letters and so on) owed to them, before paying you the initial advance. Your legal adviser can tell you how much this will be.  Just to recap, what do you need to do next? We understand there\u2019s a lot to think about. If you want to go ahead, this checklist might help you. \u25a1 Ask your legal adviser to act for you (we\u2019ve enclosed a \u2018letter of instruction\u2019 to help). \u25a1 Check your buildings insurance and contact your insurer (if you need to increase the sum insured). \u25a1 Make arrangements to meet any special conditions needed before completion. \u25a1 Arrange to see your legal adviser, taking with you: \u25a1 a form of identification (your legal adviser will tell you what\u2019s needed) \u25a1 the original buildings insurance policy schedule, your original title deeds and \u25a1 anything else your legal adviser needs. \u25a1 At the meeting, your legal adviser will ask you to sign: \f"}

Important information from the Financial Conduct Authority: \uf0b7 A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or a regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the sale of your home after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death of the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries.  \uf0b7 If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Any money left over belongs to you.  \uf0b7 If you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Again, any money left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs to move into long-term care, you don't usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either dies or moves into long-term care or another Property.  \uf0b7 If you decide that you simply don't want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount you owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an Early Repayment Charge if you do. Section 13 of this Offer document will tell you if any Early Repayment Charges apply to this mortgage.  \uf0b7 Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment - this means you borrow a lump sum which is invested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the full details of the investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents together.   \f"}

Description of this mortgage  This Offer Document is for a Saga Lifetime Mortgage provided by Just.   Interest Rate The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate of 6.75% (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage).  See Section 9 for more information regarding the Interest Rates that will apply to Additional Advances.   The Interest Rate applicable to the Initial Advance may be offered as a reduction to our current Interest Rate. Any reduction from the current Interest Rate that is applied to the Initial Advance will not be applied to borrowing from the Unused Cash Facility.  Interest Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage.  This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in Section 8.  Eligibility At the time of application, the Saga Lifetime Mortgage is only available to borrowers aged 55 and over.  The minimum Initial Advance is \u00a310,000.00, subject to your Property being acceptable to us and meeting our minimum Property value requirements.  Initial Advance This lifetime mortgage provides you with an Initial Advance of \u00a395,000.00 at Completion.  Cash Facility You will be able to borrow up to the amount of your Cash Facility of \u00a3137,500.00 (including the Initial Advance), unless certain exceptional circumstances apply as described in Section 14.  When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. See Section 14, \u2018Additional secured borrowing\u2019 for more details.  Unused Cash Facility The maximum amount that you may borrow, from your Cash Facility, following your Initial Advance, is \u00a342,500.00. This will be referred to as your Unused Cash Facility.  Additional Advances You can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property, which must be for at least the Minimum Additional Advance amount of \u00a32,000.00. Additional Advances are subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement and will be based on the terms available from Just at the time, as described in Section 14.   In exceptional circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the exceptional circumstances described in Section 14 apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you.  Estimated term We have based this Offer on an estimated term of 16 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 16 years. If you are still living in your home at the end of 16 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run. \f"}

You will also be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if the transfer does not complete. We will assess the security provided by the new Property (for example if it is of a lower value than the Property), and we may reduce your Cash Facility and ask you to repay part of the Amount Owed. If you decide not to transfer your lifetime mortgage, or we do not give our permission because, for example, the new Property is not acceptable to us and you wish to proceed with the move anyway, you must repay the Amount Owed and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as described in Section 13.  Repayment of the lifetime mortgage A \"Repayment Event\" will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. The Amount Owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the Repayment Event. You must tell us as soon as possible in writing if a Repayment Event occurs. In these circumstances, no Early Repayment Charges will be payable, as described in Section 13.  Early Repayment Charges If you repay all or part of the amount owed before the repayment event, then this will be treated as early repayment, unless you are covered by the money back guarantee. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as described in Section 13.   Future Interest Rates The interest rate for additional advances could be higher or lower in the future, as described in section 9.  Access to Additional Advances In Exceptional circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances as described in section 14. For example, a significant increase in the benchmark interest rate or a significant fall in property values may mean that your unused Cash Facility is suspended.  Inflation Inflation may erode the value of your advances and Cash Facility over time.  Tax and state benefits Taking out this lifetime mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits and may also affect your tax position. Tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need further advice you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, the Pension Service, Jobcentre Plus or your local Citizens Advice. \f"}

The actual term may be longer or shorter than the estimate. If it is longer the Amount Owed will be greater. Please ask your financial adviser if you would like another illustration based on a different term.  Change of circumstances Your circumstances might change after you take out this lifetime mortgage.  Repair and maintenance of the Property During your lifetime mortgage you must maintain the Property in good condition and repair and replace fixtures and fittings when necessary. We may decide to inspect the Property, but we will tell you at least 14 days before we intend to do this, unless there is an emergency at the Property. If the Property is not being maintained then we may ask you to carry out the repairs at your own expense. If the repairs are not made, we may arrange for the repairs to be carried out on your behalf and you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, interest will also apply to those Costs.   Other secured borrowing You must ask for our written permission if you want another mortgage or loan from another lender secured on the Property, sometimes referred to as a second charge, or wish to use the Property as security in any other way. Requests for another charge or securing other interests against the Property will be subject to individual consideration. Other lenders may not be willing to lend to you because we have a first charge on the Property and the Amount Owed will increase due to the roll-up of interest.  Other occupiers Other occupiers, for example relatives, friends or carers, will not have the right to live in the Property after you (or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you) have died, or have permanently left the Property. It is important that they understand this and we may ask them to sign an occupier consent form with the help of an independent legal adviser.  Adding a new borrower After your lifetime mortgage has Completed, you may be able to add another person as a joint borrower, subject to our lending criteria being met at the time you apply. You will also need our written permission. To add a new borrower, you will have to pay Fees to us, which might include a Valuation Fee and an Arrangement Fee. You will also be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if the transfer does not complete. If we are not reasonably satisfied that the Property provides adequate security for the new arrangement, we may reduce your Cash Facility and we may ask you to repay part of the Amount Owed. In this instance, you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as described in Section 13.  Default Event If a Default Event occurs, we have the right to take legal action to take possession of the Property and/or sell it to repay the Amount Owed. If the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you, for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries. We may take possession and/or sell the Property for any of the following reasons: \uf0b7 You do not repay the Amount Owed when it becomes payable.  \uf0b7 You do not repay the Amount Owed within 12 months from when you or each of you, if you are borrowing jointly, die, or permanently leave the Property for the purpose of Long Term Care.  \f"}

Early repayment charges Your lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care.   You have to pay early repayment charges if you want to repay all or part of your lifetime mortgage during the Early Repayment Period applicable to that advance for reasons other than those shown below. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a repayment event.   The Early Repayment Period will be shown in your Offer for each Advance.  We have based this illustration on an Early Repayment Period of 15 years.  In the first year following completion of the advance, the early repayment charge will be 10% of the amount repaid.  The early repayment charge percentage will reduce by 1% each year until year 10 where it remains at 1% until the end of year 15.  The following cash examples show the early repayment charges you would have to pay if the advance was repaid in full.

Circumstances in which Early Repayment Charges do not apply  An Early Repayment Charge is not payable if: \uf0b7 Repayment of your lifetime mortgage happens after you or each of you, if you are borrowing jointly, die or permanently leave the Property for the purposes of long term care and the evidence you have provided is reasonably satisfactory to us.  \uf0b7 Repayment of your lifetime mortgage happens within 3 years of the death or entry into permanent care of one borrower if you are borrowing jointly and the evidence you have provided is reasonably satisfactory to us.  \uf0b7 For each advance, repayment of that advance happens after the early repayment period applicable to that advance has ended.  \uf0b7 You want to move home and the new property meets our lending criteria at the time, provided that we allow you to transfer, and you transfer your lifetime mortgage to the new property.  \uf0b7 You want to move home and the new Property meets our lending criteria at the time, and you make a part repayment equal to an amount required by us because the new Property does not provide enough security (for example you move to a home of lesser value), provided that we allow you to transfer, and you transfer your lifetime mortgage to the new Property.  \uf0b7 You are repaying your lifetime mortgage within the first 6 month period following completion of the initial advance, as permitted under the money back guarantee feature described within Section 6.  \uf0b7 The amount of the repayment falls within the terms and conditions of Partial repayments without Early Repayment Charges as shown within Section 14.

Additional features  Additional borrowing without further approval The maximum amount that you may borrow, from your cash facility, following your initial advance, is \u00a342,500.00.  This will be referred to as your unused cash facility. You can request an additional advance at any time while you are still living in the property, which must be for at least the minimum additional advance amount of \u00a32,000.00. Additional advances are subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement and will be based on the terms available from Just at the time.

The overall amount owed includes fees where they have been added to the loan.  Remember that the lifetime mortgage could run for a longer or shorter time than 16 years, and if it runs for longer, the amount you owe will carry on increasing if you are not paying all of the interest. Remember also, that the interest rate on each additional advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the additional advance.  The interest rate could be higher or lower than the interest rate shown above.  We provide an additional advance Offer confirming the interest rate each time we agree to provide you with an additional advance. Your lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care.  If you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, you may have to pay a substantial Early Repayment Charge when you repay, as described in Section 13, unless you are covered by the money back guarantee.  The maximum Early Repayment Charge you could pay, if you borrowed the maximum cash facility is \u00a314,707.39. This value is calculated assuming you borrow your full cash facility (rather than borrowing a smaller initial advance) and on the same interest rate used for your initial advance within this document. In exceptional circumstances you will be unable to take additional advances.  If, when you request an additional advance any of the following exceptional circumstances apply, then your unused cash facility will not be available to you: \uf0b7 If the total of the initial advance you have received exceeds the maximum loan amount based on your age and property value at that time. \uf0b7 If Just no longer offers lifetime mortgages. \uf0b7 If the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property. \uf0b7 If the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either one of you dies. \uf0b7 If a default event occurs. \uf0b7 If Just becomes insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA or are otherwise unable reasonably to continue to do business in the lifetime market. \uf0b7 If another charge has been registered on the property.  Additional secured borrowing When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional Advance Offer.  Any increase to your Cash Facility is subject to a minimum increase of \u00a35,000.00.

Additional Advances will be based on the terms available from Just at the time.  Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing secured on your home.  Overpayments You are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge on partial repayments that do not meet the conditions set out under the heading 'Partial Payments without Early Repayment Charges' (see below). Section 13 describes how this is calculated. Making a partial repayment will not increase your unused cash facility, but may reduce your cash facility. Each partial repayment you choose to make in excess of Partial Repayments without Early Repayment Charges will be subject to a minimum payment of \u00a32,000.00. We will not accept a partial repayment, if when applied the Amount Owed, excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable, becomes less than \u00a310,000.00.  If you make a partial repayment, it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately. If you have more than one Advance, or Costs and Fees have been added to the Amount Owed, then the amount you repay will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your Advances and the Costs and Fees that have been added (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable when you make your partial repayment).   Partial repayments without Early Repayment Charges Partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the advance without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: \uf0b7 the total value of partial repayments received in the relevant 12 month period does not exceed 10% of the advance  \uf0b7 no more than a total of 6 partial repayments are made in the relevant 12 month period ; \uf0b7 each partial repayment is \u00a3500 or more; and the partial repayment does not result in the amount owed (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) becoming less than the minimum initial advance as shown in section 5.

Overall cost of this mortgage  The APR helps you to compare lifetime mortgages by giving you one rate that shows the overall cost of the mortgage. It takes into account some fees and charges as well as the interest due, and this means that the APR may be higher than the interest rate shown in Sections 5 and 8.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in some instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.You do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as described in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently leave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before this time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, Mortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents.1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority:a) your Offer Pack;b) Tariff of Charges;c) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; andd)  Mortgage Deed.2. Your Cash Facility2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The amount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.3. Your Initial Advance3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an amount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial Advance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Additional AdvancesYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your most recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. If you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to this Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer.4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The amount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your Initial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to the value of the Unused Cash Facility. 4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an Additional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional Advance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the Interest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that will apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable to the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your acceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of the Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your Additional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  bank account.4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  secured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  mortgage Agreement.5. Your Unused Cash Facility5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any Additional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each time you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the Amount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee for your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not affect the Unused Cash Facility.5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your Unused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional Advance Offer.45Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  Additional AdvancesThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an Additional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have not used all of your Cash Facility. 6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will not be available to you:a) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the Maximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage Agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property at the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; d) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the Property), and either party has died; e) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  Section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the Additional Advance;org) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section 29.2 for more details of this restriction).6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional Advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  expenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  to provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does not Complete.6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to value the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will refund the Valuation Fee to you.6Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Increasing your Cash FacilityWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing.  You can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this section. You will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. Any increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement. If we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased Cash Facility in an Additional  Advance Offer.7.2 If we agree to increase your Cash Facility, you will be able to take an Additional Advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new Unused Cash Facility. After you have taken the Additional Advance up to the full amount of your Unused Cash Facility, the Unused Cash Facility will be zero.7.3 If you decide to request an increase to your Cash Facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated Fees. Your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice.  7.4 If we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. Your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for  their advice.7.5 We may obtain a new valuation of the Property from an independent, qualified Valuer. If we do, you will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation of the Property. 7.6 If you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your Cash Facility. Also, to be eligible for an increase in your Cash Facility, you and the Property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your Cash Facility.7Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The Property as securityYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount Owed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional Advances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime.8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have signed and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the Property at the Land Registry.8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose.8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage Agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else.9. InterestThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these Monthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). 9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. The Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or lower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  an Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  time we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance. 98Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will be notified of the Interest Rate applicable to such Fees and Costs at the time they are added. The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 Interest is charged daily at the Interest Rate on each amount which forms part of the Amount Owed, from the date that amount is added to the Amount Owed, until the date the Amount Owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in Section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 The interest that is charged daily forms part of the Amount Owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged:a) for Advances, from the date the relevant Advance Completes; or b) for any other amount (including Fees and Costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the Amount Owed.Each month, the interest that is charged daily is \u2018rolled-up\u2019, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. The amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.9.7 Interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the Amount Owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before.9.8 A lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the Amount Owed.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Monthly paymentsAs part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make Monthly Payments against the amount of interest charged. The amount of your ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  Once your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop making your Monthly Payments altogether.  If you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the Monthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-up\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making Monthly Payments they cannot be restarted. This Section explains more about your options.10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance you can select to make Monthly Payments.10.2 For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum of \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.10.3 For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly Payments on your Initial Advance.10.4 The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the Advance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.10.5 Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month.10.6 Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your Monthly Payments. 10.7 You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to giving us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. The Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term.10.8 You may request one Payment Holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following Completion of the Initial Advance, providing you give us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Interest not paid during a Payment Holiday will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will \u2018roll up\u2019 on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage.10.9 If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment for any month within 3 working days of the next Monthly Payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments and you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest Rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

This section tells you more about Fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the Fees will be.11.1 The Fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these Fees are payable are described in your Initial Advance Offer.11.2 The Fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an Additional Advance and when these Fees are payable are described in each Additional Advance Offer.11.3 Other Fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the Tariff of Charges.  From time to time, we may review the Fees that we charge and we may add new Fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect :11.3.1  a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services;  or11.3.2  any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take  account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. Any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change  on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business.11.4 If we change the Fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new Tariff of Charges.12. Costs that you may need to pay During your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. You may also need to pay Costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. Throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical Costs that may arise.12.1 You must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

The Interest Rates applying to all Fees and Costs will be summarised in your annual statement.12.3 Where we add Fees or Costs to the Amount Owed, they will be treated in the same way as Advances for the purposes of charging interest and Early Repayment Charges, determining how much of your Unused Cash Facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the Amount Owed.13. The term of your lifetime mortgage13.1 Your Offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. The term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. Your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage Agreement continues to apply until the Amount Owed is repaid in full.14. Special ConditionsIn some instances we may need to apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage. These Special Conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the Property as recommended by the Valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement.  14.1 We may apply Special Conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these Special Conditions are set out in your Offer.  Special Conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage Agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve  the conflict.14.2 We may ask you to satisfy Special Conditions before your lifetime mortgage Completes. Where Special Conditions require you to take some action in relation to the Property after your lifetime mortgage Completes you will have 6 months from the date of Completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing.14.3 We may require you to provide documents to confirm that a Special Condition in relation to the Property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the Property.

Insuring the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we want to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a mortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.25.1 You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you will not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if the Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. In that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it.25.2 The insurance policy must:a) be with a reputable insurer;b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to cover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the Property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  pay for alternative accommodation;c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  other index as we reasonably require;d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require;e) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the Advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  is the earliest; andf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two Business Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.25.3 Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy.25.5 You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  to date.25Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

If we insure the Property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. You will need to pay the Costs that we incur in insuring the Property. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs.25.8 You can ask us for details of any insurance we have put in place  in respect of the Property.26. Insurance claims26.1 You must tell us as soon as possible if there is any significant loss  or damage to the Property.26.2 You must take reasonable steps to make sure that nothing  happens which may harm your or our ability to make a claim  under the insurance.26.3 If it is necessary to make a claim on your insurance you must tell the insurance company as soon as possible and assist the insurance company to resolve the claim. 26.4 We may also make a claim on your insurance and negotiate and settle any claims on your behalf.26.5 The claims money must be used to make good any loss or damage it has been paid for, or if we agree with you, it will be used to reduce or repay the Amount Owed. If there has been significant loss or damage to the Property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us.27. Maintaining the PropertyYou will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the Property. We will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the Property to a standard that exceeds the condition at the time we valued the Property, unless your Offer was subject to Special Conditions requiring repairs or other work to be carried out.27.1 During your lifetime mortgage you must maintain the Property  in good condition and repair and replace fixtures and fittings  when necessary.27.2 You must carry out any repairs or other works required by us  as a condition of your Offer by the date set by us.

Making changes to the Property You must tell us if you wish to alter the Property. We will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the Property, but we have put in place safeguards. These safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the Property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard.28.1 You must not alter the Property structurally, extend or convert the Property or change the use of the Property unless you have our written permission to do so.

You must ensure that any obligations concerning the Property, including under the planning permission and in your title deeds, are complied with.28.3 All building works must be carried out to an acceptable standard by appropriate qualified contractors. We may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to inspect the completed works and you will need to pay a non-refundable Fee for this.29. Other secured borrowingYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the Property.

Repayment on death and Long Term CareYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care. This section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. We recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event.You might also need to repay early if there is a Default Event, which is described in Section 43 of this booklet.35.1 You can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. The Amount Owed, including all of the interest, Fees and Costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the Property, although the Amount Owed can be repaid from other funds.35.2 A \u201cRepayment Event\u201d will occur when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care.

No negative equity guaranteeYour lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity guarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount Owed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.36.1 You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. If we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might be less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment Charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable Valuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.36.2 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale Proceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms of Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee.36.3 If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale Proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough to cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  Amount Owed.36.4 In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably believe that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, we may spend money on the Property in order to make it more marketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the Property. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added to the Amount Owed and interest will be charged. We will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). We will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the Property is sold. If we are unable to sell the Property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the Property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 If you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the Property has been reduced, and/or the Amount Owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the Sale Proceeds being less than the Amount Owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Early repaymentYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the Property for the purposes of Long Term Care.If you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, and repayment of an Advance happens during the Early Repayment Period which is set out in the Offer for that Advance, you may have to pay a substantial Early Repayment Charge when you repay. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a Repayment Event.If you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.You should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.37.1 If you repay all or part of the Amount Owed before a Repayment Event as explained in Section 35 (which explains when a Repayment Event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. You can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge as set out in more detail below. Early Repayment Charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in Section 41.37.2 We require at least 14 days\u2019 written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. We will then calculate the Amount Owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any Early Repayment Charge due at that time).37.3 You can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the Amount Owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period.37.4 If the Amount Owed is repaid as a result of a Default Event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an Early Repayment Charge may be payable.37Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Partial repaymentYou are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, subject to certain limits specified in the Offer Pack and as set out in Section 38.7 below, but you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge on any partial repayment that you make in excess of these limits. Making a partial repayment will not increase your Unused Cash Facility, but may reduce your Cash Facility.If you are making Monthly Payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge and Section 38.7 will not apply.You should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser.38.1 If there is any repayment of part of the Amount Owed, we may reduce your Cash Facility and you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge.38.2 Each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your Initial Advance Offer  unless the conditions set out in Section 38.7 are met in respect  of that partial repayment. Section 38.7 does not apply if you  are making Monthly Payments and so any partial repayment  you choose to make whilst making Monthly Payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an Early Repayment Charge. 38.3 We will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the Amount Owed to a value that is less than (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable) the minimum Initial Advance as set out in your Initial Advance Offer. This does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the Property.38.4 If there is any partial repayment it will reduce the Amount Owed immediately. If you have more than one Advance, or Costs and Fees have been added to the Amount Owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your Advances, and the Costs and Fees that have been added (excluding any Early Repayment Charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 If you are making Monthly Payments, as detailed within Section 10, then Section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an Early Repayment Charge if those repayments are within the Early Repayment Period.38.6 Partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the Advance without being subject to an  Early Repayment Charge provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:38Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

Any partial repayment will be allocated between Advances and any Fees and Costs in proportion to the Advance and Fees and Costs when  compared to the Amount Owed. The partial repayment will  be allocated between capital and interest. This split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and  the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest).b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in Section 38.6, an Early Repayment Charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the Early Repayment Period. This charge could be zero . If this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. If the Early Repayment Charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.39. Early Repayment ChargesIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early.We offer a two different Early Repayment Charge options; Variable and Fixed. The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your Offer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime Mortgage. Further details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash examples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each Additional Advance Offer.

Fees and Costs may be applied to the Advance and these will increase the Amount Owed. Please refer to the Definitions section for details on when Fees and Costs may be applied. The Early Repayment Charge will be applied to the total Amount Owed. 39.2 A maximum Early Repayment Charge will apply to your Initial Advance and will be shown in your Initial Advance Offer A maximum Early Repayment Charge will also apply to each Additional Advance and will be shown in each Additional  Advance Offer 39.3 If you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your Early Repayment Charge payable at that time.Variable Early Repayment Charge 39.4 The Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining Early Repayment Period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use Benchmark Interest Rates to take account of these movements). The way we calculate the Variable Early Repayment Charge is set out in your Offer. We have set out a worked example of how the Variable Early Repayment Charge is calculated in the Early Repayment Charge guide.Fixed Early Repayment Charge 39.5 The Fixed Early Repayment Charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid.  The amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest.  The Early Repayment Charge percentage will reduce throughout the Early Repayment Period.  After the end of the Early Repayment Period, an Early Repayment Charge will not be payable. The Fixed Early Repayment Charge structure and a worked example is set out in your Offer and our Early Repayment Charge Guide40. Benchmark Interest Rates (applicable to the Variable Early Repayment Charge only)The Variable Early Repayment Charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use \u201cBenchmark Interest Rates\u201d to take account of these movements. For this, we use the UK FTSE 15 Year Gilt Yield Index. This Index is published daily in The Financial Times (under \u201cGilts \u2013 UK FTSE Actuaries Indices\u201d, \u201cYield Indices\u201d, \u201c15 yrs\u201d). For each Advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the Offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. Your Offer will show the Benchmark Interest Rate and the Target Benchmark Interest Rate for the Advance.40.1 On any Business Day, we use the Benchmark Interest Rate published on the previous Business Day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the Business Day before that.40Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

What is a breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement? If you fail to do something you agreed to do, for example insuring and maintaining the Property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the Property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement. This section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement.If there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage Agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home.42.1 If you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage Agreement then this is a breach.42.2 If a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. We will allow you a reasonable time to do so. We will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the Property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender.42.3 If you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the Property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. For example, this may require us to enter the Property and carry out repairs.42.4 If we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any Costs that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask,  we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply  to those Costs.42.5 Where we have to take action or incur Costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of Costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement (whether or not we add Costs to the Amount Owed because you have not paid them).42.6 If you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee.

Giving notice54.1 We will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters we send will be sent to you at the Property, unless you have given us another address to use.54.2 You must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage Agreement. Any letters you send must be sent to Just Retirement Money Limited at the address in the \u2018About us\u2019 section, unless we have given you another address to use.55. Variations for Properties in Scotland Due to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland then this section will apply to you.55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If the Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. In Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy.55.2 Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, this means a standard security under the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security.55.3 In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are references to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for a house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that they do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d means owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property under a lease.5455Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

You will see reference to a court judgement in Section 9.7.55.5 Section 15 refers to occupiers.  In Scotland, if the occupier is  your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the Property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have.55.6 Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives.55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.55.8 If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into possession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  sell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 Act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 Act.55.9 There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section 45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.55.10 5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver.55.11 We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. For example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We may exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we take some action in relation to the Property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. This means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for example, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. We may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. You will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply to those Costs. If the Property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. If we sell the Property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. If we sell the Property and the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries.Call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk\f"}

This must be their main residence on  a continual basis. For joint applications, customers must own the property on either a joint tenants or tenants in common basis. \u2022 Own an acceptable property worth \u00a370,000 or over in the UK. Please see our \u2018Lending Criteria Guide\u2019 for further details.Initial advance The minimum initial advance is \u00a310,000 (or \u00a320,000 if some or all of the monthly interest is being paid). This must be drawn on completion of the lifetime mortgage. The initial advance will be paid to the account of the customer\u2019s legal adviser. If any part of the initial advance is needed to  pay off an outstanding mortgage or secured loan, this amount will be  paid directly to the lender. All payments will be made in sterling. Cash facility Customers have the option of taking a cash facility at the start of their lifetime mortgage. The interest rate applicable to the initial advance and any subsequent borrowing will be higher than if this option were not selected. The maximum cash facility will be capped at the maximum LTV available based on the age of the youngest customer (with an absolute maximum of \u00a3200,000 remaining in the facility). The unused cash facility will therefore be the balance of the maximum loan amount permitted by customer age less the initial advance.The cash facility is guaranteed to be available for the life of the mortgage, unless one of the following occurs:  \u2022If the total of all the advances exceeds the maximum loan amount based on the borrowers age and property value at the time the request for an additional advance is made. \u2022If we, or another provider (if we have transferred the lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages. \u2022If the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time the request for an additional advance is made. \u2022If the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either party has died. \u2022If a default event occurs. \u2022If, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the additional advance. \u2022If a second charge has been registered on the property.We sometimes accept applications on behalf of individuals by attorneys. But there must be a suitable enduring or lasting power of attorney registered  with the relevant authority in the country of residence.Call 0345 302 2287 or visit justadviser.com\f"}

Customers can ask for additional advances from their cash facility  at any time. These are subject to a minimum of \u00a32,000 per release,  and the customer won\u2019t have to take further financial advice. We do not charge any administration fee for a release from the existing cash facility. Monthly payment option Customers can choose to pay some or all of the monthly interest amount by Direct Debit. The minimum they can pay is \u00a325, up to 100% of the monthly interest amount. A reduction to the roll-up interest rate may apply for customers who decide to pay some or all of the monthly interest amount, this will be detailed in the customers offer documentation.If they need to take a temporary break from the monthly payments, providing they give us 1 months notice, they can take a payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in any 12 month period following the completion of the loan. The monthly interest not paid during the payment holiday will be added to the loan and roll up on a compound basis.If they wish to stop making monthly payments altogether, they can do so at any time, at which point the lifetime mortgage will switch to a full roll-up of interest basis. For customers who received a reduction to the roll-up interest rate due to paying some or all of their monthly interest amount, the interest rate applicable to the loan will increase. Once payments have ceased they cannot be restarted. The loan will convert to a full interest roll-up basis once 6 monthly payments have been missed and the interest rate applicable may increase.Medically underwritten option Using our expert underwriting capability, depending upon the underlying customer need, customers who qualify for this option may be able to borrow a loan at a higher loan-to-value or achieve their borrowing requirements at a lower rate of interest than an \u2018equivalent\u2019 healthy customer.A medical questionnaire is required to determine whether the customer(s) will qualify for enhanced terms. Although the questions are not mandatory, all answered questions have the potential to impact on whether the customer(s) will qualify.

A property valuation may be needed for additional advances outside the cash facility. If so, we\u2019ll charge for this, which won\u2019t be more than the normal valuation fee applicable to new business at the time. There\u2019s no administration fee for additional advances. Additional advances can be requested by the customer(s) directly or via an authorised financial adviser in writing, by phone, email, or fax.

The rate is guaranteed for six weeks from the date of issue of the offer. If the advance isn\u2019t completed within six weeks, the offer will expire. Any replacement offer will be in line with the terms available at the time, so the interest rate may change. Interest is charged on a monthly basis and added to the outstanding balance each month on the payment due date. Interest is charged from the date the advance is released to the borrower\u2019s legal adviser, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full, or in the event of early repayment until the latter of either the date the amount owed is repaid in full or if repaid before the end of the 14 day notice period until the end of that notice period.For additional advances the interest rate will be set at the time it\u2019s requested. Customers will be informed of the rate in writing. Once again, this interest rate will be guaranteed for six weeks from the date the confirmation is issued. If the additional advance is not drawn within six weeks of the confirmation, the offer will expire. Any replacement offer will be in line with the terms available at the time, so once again the interest rate may change. Please note, in section 8 of the Key Facts Illustration (KFI) we take into account calendar years rather than compounding years. Therefore if the customer is servicing 100% of the monthly interest amount, the balance in the table in section 8 may include some interest. For example, if a customer completes their initial advance on 2 January 2021 and has chosen to service 100% of their monthly interest amount with a payment date of the 15th of each month, section 8 of the KFI would show in year 1 the balance at the end of  2 January 2022. By this date interest has accumulated from 15 December 2021 (the last payment) to 2 January 2022. However the customer hasn\u2019t had a chance to pay that off as their direct debit date isn\u2019t until 15 January 2022. Therefore the interest that has been accumulated is included in the balance  in section 8.Fees, remuneration and charges To find out more about fees, remuneration and charges, see our \u2018Just For You Lifetime Mortgage \u2013 at a glance\u2019 guide.

It\u2019s designed to be repaid only when your customer (or both customers, in the case of borrowing jointly) has died or permanently moved into long-term care.The mortgage must be repaid within 12 months from when your customer (or both customers in the case of borrowing jointly) has died or permanently moved into long-term care. For example, your customer might move into a care home or live with and be cared for by relatives on a permanent basis due to medical necessity. If the mortgage isn\u2019t repaid within 12 months, we may appoint  a representative to market and sell the property. If the mortgage is repaid at any time before the death or entry into permanent long-term care of all applicants, then the customer(s)  may have to pay an early repayment charge. The mortgage may also have to be repaid if the property is left vacant  for more than three months. Usually the mortgage will be repaid from the sale proceeds of the property, but it can be repaid from other funds if needed. Voluntary early repayment If your customer(s) repay their lifetime mortgage early, there may be an early repayment charge to pay. This is to protect us against the financial consequences of their decision not to keep the mortgage for the full term. We do not charge an exit administration fee for early repayment. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if the lifetime mortgage is repaid early.   We offer two different Early Repayment Charge options: Variable and Fixed.  The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to the offer letter to understand which option applies to the Lifetime Mortgage.Further details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash examples are included in the Initial Advance Offer and each Additional Advance Offer. The Guide to our early repayment charge contains helpful information about Early Repayment Charges.    If your customer pays back their lifetime mortgage in full, we won\u2019t charge an early repayment charge if: \u2022the mortgage is repaid after they die or permanently move into long-term care; or \u2022if they\u2019ve held their mortgage for longer than the early repayment period. If your customers have borrowed jointly, we won\u2019t charge an early repayment charge if the lifetime mortgage is repaid: \u2022within three years of the death of one borrower; Call 0345 302 2287 or visit justadviser.com\f"}

If not making monthly payments, customers are able to repay some of their lifetime mortgage without having to pay an early repayment charge. For each advance, they can pay back up to 10% of the advance amount in each 12-month period following completion, in up to six instalments providing they are not servicing any of the monthly interest amount. The minimum overall amount they can pay in each instalment is \u00a3500, and the remaining amount owed must be at least \u00a310,000. If more than one advance has been taken, we will allocate the amount repaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. If the amount repaid is more than 10% there may be an early repayment charge payable. Also, if the customer(s) sell their property and transfers the lifetime mortgage to a new property that is acceptable to us, we may ask them to make a part repayment. This may happen, for example, if the customer(s) new property is worth less than their existing one. If this happens, we won\u2019t charge an early repayment charge on that part repayment.No-negative-equity guarantee As long as the customers have complied with the terms and conditions, they won\u2019t have to pay more than the sale proceeds of the property, even if it\u2019s less than the amount owed. There\u2019s no added charge for this guarantee. Valuation report Before we make an offer, we need a property valuation which is an estimation of the worth of the customer\u2019s property carried out by a professional valuer. We choose a surveyor to carry out the valuation. Moving home If your customers want to move home, it may be possible to transfer their lifetime mortgage to a new property, if the new property is acceptable to us. One condition is that the sale of the old property and purchase of the new property take place at the same time. If the new property has a higher value than the old property, it may be possible to apply for a further advance. But this is subject to the lending criteria at the time. In some instances, for example if the customer is transferring the lifetime mortgage to a lower value property, we may reduce the cash facility. We may ask the customer to repay part of the amount owed in line with lending criteria applicable at the time. We do not charge an application fee for transferring the lifetime mortgage. If the customer has taken more than one advance, we will allocate the amount repaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. There will be no early repayment charge in these circumstances. If customers choose to repay more than required, an early repayment charge will apply only to the extra amount repaid. The new property will need to be valued by a surveyor. We\u2019ll choose a surveyor to do the valuation. The valuation fee will be the fee applicable to a new Just Lifetime Mortgage at the time. Your customer will be responsible for all the costs of moving. Find out more about early repayment charges in our \u2018Guide to early  repayment charge\u2019.

You are required to explain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.  The provider will not complete the transaction until they have received a Certificate which has been signed and completed by both you and your client(s), whereby you confirm that you have drawn your client\u2019s(s\u2019) attention to the risks of entering into an equity release transaction and your client(s) confirms that he/they has/have been given the advice set out in the Certificate.Guidance on Independence Clients must use a legal adviser who is independent of the provider\u2019s solicitor.  If you are advising a client in relation to an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent of the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013 \u00b7the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or Wales); or\u00b7the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\u00b7the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of Scotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which take place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s Rules & GuidancePayment of Fees Whilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to this guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients to you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to you.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not be calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.This also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected with the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative or marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel membership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of staff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision or purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).  For the avoidance of doubt, certain marketing payments which are not connected with payment on a case-by-case basis are permitted, subject to the regulatory obligations of the parties concerned. You must inform your client(s) in writing of the amount and frequency of any financial arrangement, including marketing contributions, when issuing the customer case documentation at the outset.If the customer chooses not to instruct their own legal adviser, the adviser or provider (as appropriate) may offer the name of at least one local law firm which has knowledge of equity release products.  The adviser or provider must ensure that no pressure or financial inducement is involved in directing customers to any particular law firm either by them or the intermediaries recommending their products.Receipt of Payments If you are acting on behalf of the client you may not receive payments or other consideration from the adviser or provider if that payment is dependent on the completion of an equity release transaction. \f"}

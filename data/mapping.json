property: in our experience, it is sometimes intended that some (or all) of the proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from viva retirement solutions and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we recommend that you do so. i enclose a form with this letter, and i should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. once you have completed the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. please be aware that i will not be able to complete your equity release until i am in receipt of a completed and signed form. please contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand or if you would like to discuss in more detail. yours sincerely, natasha wakefield natasha.wakefield@equilaw.uk.com to book a call with me visit

undertaken is supervised by karla mutlow (fcilex). in the event that i, or your case handler cannot resolve your query please do not hesitate to contact karla or in her absence our compliance director david bush or our ceo claire barker (solicitor). security we take your protection against identity theft very seriously. we are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your equity release funds, we must guarantee your identity to the lenders. we can only do this by reference to government issued photographic identification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us as our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. if you do not have such documentation we will require you to complete our identity verification form. in order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your exact bank details otherwise the banking system will reject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you. in order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment. enclosed is our frequently asked questions sheet and cybercrime leaflet which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud. please note that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you notify us to the contrary. scope of work equilaw ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the equity release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser viva retirement solutions, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges if you have any secured loans, overdrafts or mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your equity release. fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 699.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds. disbursements 2", "49": "disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control. we may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard equity release matter (and therefore outside of the fixed fee). as soon as we are aware of any we will notify you. marketing fees both equilaw and viva retirement solutions specialise in the equity release industry. as such, we have a relationship with them which includes mutual advertising, the monitoring of completion times and a dedication to ensuring a smooth transaction. there is also a financial relationship between us whereby equilaw pays a monthly marketing contribution of 11,000.00 . despite this relationship, we will provide you with independent advice and you are able to raise questions with us about any aspect of your case. signed plan please find enclosed a plan, obtained from the land registry, outlining what i believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return to me. if the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent. it is important that the plan is accurate. if you own any additional land, please identify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct. next steps please review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to enable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to equilaw such as account details for existing charges, details of any occupiers or your management company (if leasehold) details. on receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer through to completion. the offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lenders solicitors (who will then send it to us). we will issue and send you a \" legal report pack\". this pack will come directly from equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you will receive from more 2 life directly. offers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. we will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from more 2 life's solicitors. we have to await this pack of documents as it contains the legal documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our solicitor. on average there is a delay of approximately 3 working days between you receive the offer and us. if we have not contacted you after 3 days (from your receipt of the offer directly from more 2 life) please contact me so that i may chase more 2 life's solicitors for this documentation. once we receive the offer from more 2 life's solicitors, we will contact you to book a face to face appointment will our attending solicitor. we have produced a short information video demonstrating how the appointment can safely proceed https://youtu.be/e3grm6pp4fm . we would urge you to review the video so that you know what to expect and so that you can raise any question or queries relating to the appointment. we have been successfully conducting meetings in this manner since the start of the pandemic, so you are in safe hands with equilaw. we are: closely following public health england and nhs guidance, asking our attending solicitors to self-certify weekly that they have not (to the best of their knowledge) come into contact with any at risk individuals, arranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; re-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; adapting our face to face meetings to be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; ensuring that all staff are issued with ppe and sanitiser. we believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the erc guidelines, adhere to the law of property act requirements, adhere to the solicitors regulation authority code of conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. if you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know. it is a matter for you to decide if you wish to proceed. if there are additional precautions that can be taken to minimise any risk of infection to you, please let us know. it is mandatory, under law of property act 1925, for a deed to be lawfully executed that it must be executed in the presence of a physically present independent person. deeds cannot, under any circumstances, be executed via video call. once we have booked the appointment, we will send to you our legal report pack. this pack contains the documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our solicitor and without it the appointment cannot proceed. if you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us. completion we will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the lender to seek your authorisation to complete. as the action rests with more 2 lifes solicitors to carry out their pre-completion checks we cannot give a precise time estimate. our final bill and completion statement will be sent to you following completion. we will pay your net funds directly into your bank account by bacs in three days. if you wish to obtain your funds on the same day as completion we are able to offer a premium same day service if at an additional cost of 40 +vat. please notify us if you do want to upgrade to the premium payment service and we will amend our records, but please note that funds are usually not received from the lenders solicitors until mid-afternoon on the day of completion, such that same day transfer to you is not always possible. there are certain parts of the transaction where we must use same day bank transfer, for example, paying off an existing charge and this is beyond our control. 3", "50": " after completion any original documents will be returned to you after completion. we will store our file for 6 years, as required by our regulators, after which time the file

property: in our experience, it is sometimes intended that some (or all) of the proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from viva retirement solutions and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we recommend that you do so. i enclose a form with this letter, and i should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. once you have completed the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. please be aware that i will not be able to complete your equity release until i am in receipt of a completed and signed form. please contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand or if you would like to discuss in more detail. yours sincerely, natasha wakefield natasha.wakefield@equilaw.uk.com to book a call with me visit

their supervisor. we aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day and to respond to written communications within two working days. your responsibilities you will provide us with

where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you. our charges our engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. together these set out the basis on which we will charge you. this will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we are unable to complete your work within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why. we will carry on and complete any additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work done, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in

leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement. in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity release application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs. solicitors appointments where we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving less than two working days notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we will charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit. note that working day in this context means monday to friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. note also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity

will be due for payment. you must have your mortgage offer in writing and our legal report pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by 1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges. indemnity insurance occasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client and/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider. where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the cost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule. shortfall if you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together with the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake checks in accordance with the money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds (information on the payer) regulations 2019, and we cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made. once the funds have been approved, please note that payments by debit card (we can accept up to 2,000) take 2 working days

jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application

responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account. we expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. all interim statute bills are due for payment on delivery. payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling either by cheque payable to equilaw limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request). shortfalls and completion funds we do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage. we are obliged under the anti money laundering regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax. (net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.) regulation and limits on our services we will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any

regulated by the financial conduct authority (fca) or the prudential regulation authority (pra) but we are included on the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: ls

property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next. 15", "62": "additional fees (if required) (plus vat) mining report from 99 removal of

targeted by fraudsters over the last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information.

ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing

aspects of the equity release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser viva retirement solutions, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges if you have any secured loans, overdrafts or mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your equity release. fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 699.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds. disbursements", "77": "disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control. we may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard equity release matter (and therefore outside of the fixed fee). as soon as we are aware of any we will notify you. marketing fees both equilaw and viva retirement

best of their knowledge) come into contact with any at risk individuals, arranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; re-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; adapting our face to face meetings to be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; ensuring that all staff are issued with ppe and sanitiser. we believe that, by adopting these measures, we

do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we

remain liable for the cost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule.

to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other associated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, ifa or introducer from monies received or held on your behalf (including

establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax.

", "84": "faq 1. do i have to send in my title deeds? if your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.", "85":

special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or a regular income. the amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the sale of your home after death. if you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death of the last borrower. any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries. if you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. otherwise you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. any money left over belongs to you. if you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. again, any money left over belongs to you. if you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs to move into long-term care, you dont usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either dies or moves into long-term care or another property. if you decide that you simply dont want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount you owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do. section 13 of this offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage. some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment this means you borrow a lump sum which is invested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. if this happens the full details of the investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents together. 4. what you have told us you want an offer for the flexi choice plan. your details: male 83 years female 80 years your property has been valued at: 795,000.00 construction: standard you want

insurance charges, see section 12. the remainder of your cash facility that is not drawn down at the start of your mortgage is subject to a minimum draw down amount of 2,000 each time (or the full amount of the remaining facility if less than 2,000), and is also subject to the conditions described in section 5. changes to any of the information you have given us, could alter the information in this offer. if this is the case ask for a revised offer. fc v1.30 1121 page 3 of 15", "139": "lifetime mortgage offer 5. description of this mortgage this offer is for a flexi choice plan provided by more 2 life limited. it provides you with a cash lump sum at the start of the loan and a cash facility which you may be able to draw cash from after your initial lump sum loan completion, subject to a minimum withdrawal of 2,000 or withdrawal of the remaining facility if less than 2,000. you do not have to make any payments during the life of this lifetime mortgage. you can apply direct to more 2 life limited for further borrowing of the remaining amount of this facility without further financial advice. this borrowing is not guaranteed and will be based on the terms available from more 2 life limited at the time. the remaining cash facility will be reduced or removed: if the product is no longer offered by the lender, the lender is no longer in business, rothesay life plc are no longer funding the lender, or to comply with the regulations governing either the lender or rothesay life plc if, the total of (i) the amount outstanding under your lifetime mortgage (including your initial lump sum, any subsequent cash advances, accrued interest and any charges you have incurred) plus (ii) any unused part of your cash facility, exceeds the amount we would agree to lend to a new borrower (of equivalent age) in comparable circumstances. if the facility is fully withdrawn for this reason, you can repay your lifetime mortgage in full without incurring early repayment charges if any of the events of default specified in the loan and mortgage conditions as causing the agreement to terminate and making the balance immediately due and payable has occurred or have failed to maintain the property in good condition. if you are subject to an undischarged bankruptcy or individual voluntary arrangement (iva) or have been discharged from bankruptcy or an iva if you own the property as tenants in common, where one applicant dies, the remaining borrower cannot access any unutilised cash facility when they are not the sole beneficiary of the deceaseds share of the property. any such further borrowing will be based on the interest rate available from more 2 life limited at the time of application for this product taking account of your then age and the value of your property relative to your total outstanding balance and any unutilised cash facility. the interest rate applicable to such further borrowing may be more or less than your initial interest rate. the offer that we give you at the time of any cash advance will set out the interest rate for that cash advance. this lifetime mortgage can only be arranged for either one or two people between the ages of 55 - 84, based on the age of the youngest applicant, who own and live permanently in the property which is subject to the lifetime mortgage. if there are any other outstanding mortgages or charges at the time the loan is taken out, you will be required to use the lifetime mortgage to clear these loans. as part of the completion process our solicitors will redeem them with the proceeds from the loan. interest is charged at a fixed rate of 6.62% on the initial advance until receipt by more 2 life limited of all monies due. the interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly, meaning the interest rolls up with interest being charged on that interest, paid when you repay your loan. see section 8 for example. any cash advances will be subject to the new interest rate payable at the time which will be set out in the offer that we give you for that cash advance, and will be based on your then age and the value of your property relative to your total outstanding balance and any unutilised cash facility, and which will then be fixed for the lifetime of the loan. we have based this offer on an estimated term of 15 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 15 years. if you are still living in your home at the end of 15 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run. the loan, accrued interest and charges that may be due, become payable out of the proceeds from the sale of your home under the following circumstances; on your death, or (if joint borrowers) on the death of the last borrower. if you move home and transferring this lifetime mortgage to the new property does not meet our lending conditions. if you move into residential or long-term care on the grounds of medical or other specialist advice. any money left over would be paid to you or your beneficiaries. the maximum amount you can borrow is 318,000.00. however, if you change the loan amount currently requested, the rate of interest may also change. if you require additional funds you may apply for further secured borrowing subject to availability - see section 14 for details. fc v1.30 1121 page 4 of 15", "140":

the amount repaid; up to the 7th anniversary the charge is 4% of the amount repaid; up to the 8th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid; up to the 9th anniversary the charge is 2% of the amount repaid; up to the 15th anniversary the charge is 1% of the amount repaid; after 15th anniversary is no charge. voluntary payments voluntary partial early repayments more 2 life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge provided: the total amount of voluntary payments does not exceed 10% of the total cash advanced per annum; minimum payment of 50, unlimited instalments. please note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, the early repayment charge will attach. where you do make partial repayments this will reduce the level of loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up. any unused 10% annual allowance cannot be carried forward to subsequent periods. if you plan to move house, as set out above, and a partial repayment is required due to your new home being of lower value no early repayment charge will be payable. general standard points of equity release mortgage: property must be insured at all times property must be

your selected equity release mortgage plan, to advise you of your legal obligations and the effect of the equity release mortgage on you and the property. in term of suitability for your needs, you must rely entirely on the financial advice and guidance provided by your financial adviser or the plan providers representative. equilaw cannot give you any financial advice regarding the plans suitability for your circumstances and requirements, now or in the future. if you are not absolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your financial adviser before proceeding further. if you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you have sought further financial advice, from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment may not exceed the interest charged on this product. any existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the property must be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release. if you do not intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding further. unless we hear from you to the contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity release funds paid to you on completion. additionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the equity release. the effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against your home. please ensure that you have reviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances. if this applies in your case, you will find details in the special conditions section of this report. you may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance tax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees. the rules and regulations relating to gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. the equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose, without careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. please also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life. further information and guidance is produced by age uk and can be found at www.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information- guides-and-factsheets/ . it is important to review and/or make a will in the context of taking out an equity release plan. making a will can achieve significant savings in tax and costs of winding up your estate. it also means that your assets will be distributed in accordance with your wishes and not as provided for by the general laws of intestacy. you should also consider making a lasting power of attorney, which can safeguard your position and ensure that your wishes are carried out in relation to the property, health and finances in the event that you become incapable of handling these decisions personally in the future. if you would like to discuss these matters please let me know and i will put you in touch with an appropriate specialist. you should read this report, together with

scheme? 1.1 product type following advice from your financial adviser, , more 2 life - flexi choice lump sum lifetime mortgage - lifetime general loan conditions and mortgage conditions (2019 ed.) has been selected as the most suitable product for your requirements. this is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home. 1.2 amount of loan the maximum amount that more 2 life are willing to lend is 318,000.00. at the date of completion, you will receive a lump sum of 50,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). you will also have access to a cash facility of 50,000.00. more 2 life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the property as security for this loan. you can apply to more 2 life for additional borrowing. more 2 life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. 1.3 cash facility following completion, you will have access to a cash facility of 50,000.00. you will not be charged interest on the cash facility until you draw funds from it. when you do withdraw funds, more 2 life will charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher or lower than the original rate in this offer of 6.62%. please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the cash facility. you can apply at any time, to more 2 life to borrow any amount within your cash facility subject to a minimum amount of 2,000.00. please note that more 2 life does have the right to withdraw the cash facility at any time, as set out in section 5 of the offer. 1.4 interest the interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 6.62%. interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly. you are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. unpaid interest will be added to the loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (rolling up). the interest continues to roll up, at the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid. over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments). if house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the property will be eroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the property. the requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the property has been abandoned. this will either be because you have died, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the property. please note that interest continues to roll up until the mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the property); it will not stop just because you are no longer living there. section 8 of the offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. the loan period may be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest which accrues. the annual percentage rate is 7%. 1.5 inheritance protection more 2 life offers inheritance protection. this allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the property, but ultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow. you have opted not to protect any of the equity in the property. please note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to opt for inheritance protection will have been lost. if you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would like to protect a proportion of the property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to completion. 5", "170": "1.6 no negative equity guarantee. more 2 life provides a no negative equity guarantee. this means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or your estate owe more than the value of your home, more 2 life will not seek to recover any further amount than the proceeds of sale. this guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the terms and conditions of the plan. for example, keeping the property in good repair and condition. the guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by more 2 life. the guarantee only applies when the property is sold to repay the loan. it will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the property and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your property will reduce the available equity for a new property. all of the lenders that belong to the equity release council offer a no-negative equity guarantee which means that if the level of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any shortfall. however, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee. this is not specified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so i cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything). the downside is that if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not need. however, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable. there is not currently an equity release council approved product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which meets council standards, there is no alternative. if you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your financial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you. 1.7 once the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of the loan you are taking, versus the value of your property. compound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future). 1.8 moving house it is possible to move to a different property, under the terms of the scheme (please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions) provided that the property you want to move to is acceptable to more 2 life. however, this is not guaranteed. examples of where more 2 life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another property might include a flat, where the lease does not have enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the property is of non-standard construction. if more 2 life are agreeable to porting your mortgage to a new property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. if you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve more 2 life from the outset. the solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with more 2 lifes solicitors at all stages to ensure that more 2 life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend. only once more 2 life have confirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to exchange. you must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new property without more 2 lifes consent. if your proposed new property is not acceptable to more 2 life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract an early repayment charge. if your proposed new home does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge. you should always obtain more 2 life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in the event that this is not possible 1.9 sale of part of your property if you are seeking to sell part of your property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell more 2 life and seek more 2 lifes prior consent. if the sale of part of your property reduces the value of your property you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. 1.10 taxation on the loan the loan is tax-free under present legislation. 6", "171": "whilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and governments can apply any new rules retrospectively. if such a change occurred, you may have to pay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax position. however, this is unlikely. 7", "172": "2. what will it cost to set up? 2.1 financial advisers fee we have been advised by viva retirement solutions that fees of 750.00 have been agreed between you. we will pay this amount directly to viva retirement solutions from your completion funds. 2.2 legal fees you are responsible for equilaws fees, disbursements and vat of 699.00, as detailed in our initial estimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for extra work, as applicable. 2.3 other costs more 2 life and/or their solicitors may, from time to time, have additional disbursement costs. we are not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is provided with the intended completion date. we will always make you aware of any additional disbursements as soon as we are made aware. 8", "173": "3. your obligations and what you have agreed to do 3.1 borrowing you have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) out of the equity release funds and cannot use your home as security for any further borrowing, unless more 2 life gives its written permission. 3.2 who can live in the property? only the people named in the mortgage offer are allowed to live at the property. 3.3 moving a new person into the property if you want somebody else to move into your home, you must seek more 2 lifes authority to do so. the new occupier will be required to sign the lender's occupier's waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees) before they move in. if you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan in the name of the proposed joint owners. if more 2 life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to repay part of the loan (without early repayment charge). 3.4 residence this must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. if you are planning to leave your property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform more 2 life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so. it is important that you do this so that more 2 life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges. you must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the property. usually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the property empty for 30 days or more. 3.5 you can live in the property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage conditions). please carefully read more 2 lifes terms and conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions (including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the terms and conditions). 3.6 right to inspect the property more 2 life is entitled to inspect the property periodically to ensure that the terms and conditions of the loan are being complied with. more 2 life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of emergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse. this is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is set out at section 10 in the terms and conditions. 3.7 repair & maintenance you have agreed to keep the property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting it fall into disrepair. if more 2 life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done within the time stipulated or more 2 life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it. if you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage and interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up. please also note that if you do not keep the property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out the repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee. 3.8 insurance you must keep the property fully insured, by a company approved by more 2 life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to 9", "174": "restore the property, to its present condition. if it is damaged or destroyed the policy should include cover demolition, site clearance and architects plans to rebuild the property. the reinstatement sum insured as assessed by more 2 lifes valuer and must be no less than 400,000.00. we will require sight of the new insurance policy prior to completion, to enable us to demonstrate that it meets more 2 lifes requirements. more 2 life should be noted on your buildings insurance as per the terms and conditions and you may need to send more 2 life a copy of your buildings insurance each year, so that they can check that you have the necessary insurance cover. if the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. a copy will be required for completion, please send to us, if not already done so. if you do not insure your property more 2 life will do this for you but will re-charge you for the cost of the insurance to you. you must pay these sums once notified, should you fail to do so more 2 life will charge interest on the amount outstanding. these costs will fall outside of the no negative equity guarantee. you should also note that any insurance arranged by more 2 life will be suitable for more 2 lifes purposes but many not be suitable for you. we recommend that you always source your own index linked insurance. if an insurable event e.g. a fire, occurs you must immediately inform more 2 life. any monies paid under the insurance policy to you must be used to repair and make good the loss and damage or repay the total debt owing. 3.9 impact on your estate you should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate which you are able to leave to them on your death. it is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the property to move into long term care. they will need to notify more 2 life of this event and be aware of more 2 lifes requirements regarding repayment of the loan. 3.10 legal notice, orders or proposals effecting your property. you must inform more 2 life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the property. 3.11 alterations to the property you must seek more 2 lifes permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the property (e.g., new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations approval) this is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from more 2 life in principle as, if the lender refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work. lenders do not usually withhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects. if you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as green deal) you must first obtain the written permission of more 2 life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the property, which is not allowed by more 2 life). 3.12 acquiring additional land adjoining the property if you buy or acquire any land next to the property please notify more 2 life. more 2 life may require you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land. this is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the property (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions. 3.13 renting out the property you cannot rent out the property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself. if you wish to do so, please contact more 2 life. if more 2 life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a buy to let loan. your financial adviser will be able to assist you. 3.14 business use you cannot use your home for business purposes. if you wish to do so you must contact more 2 life to seek its permission. 10", "175": "3.15 impact on benefits receipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits. if you think you may be entitled to any such benefits, or you receive means- tested benefits already, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore your options in advance of taking up this equity release. 11", "176": "4. when does the loan have to be repaid? 4.1 the loan contract ends when: the last owner of the property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of care in the terms and conditions, which you should read carefully); or if you purchase another property and the loan cannot be ported; or the property is permanently abandoned; or if you become bankrupt; or if you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the terms and conditions. the amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by more 2 life (for example repair costs). the term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 15 years. this does not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase. 4.2 impact of loan ending due to death or long term care if the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then more 2 life may request medical or other specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). the term will also end on death. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). 4.3 sale of the property you or your attorney (if you have appointed one under a power of attorney) or personal representatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the property. if the property is not sold within 12 months more 2 life may take over conduct of the sale. this would usually be if more 2 life perceived no progress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances. by signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint more 2 life under a power of attorney in relation to the property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. that said, if you are still capable of dealing with your own affairs, or have your own attorney, more 2 life would not usually get involved. however, it does mean that more 2 life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the property, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the property at the end of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so. 4.4 bankruptcy and/or breach of material contract terms the loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the terms and conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in the terms and conditions. please note that early repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances. 4.5 early repayment charges. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the terms and conditions. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this prior to the 15 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge. the early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date: up to the 1st anniversary the charge is 10% of the amount repaid; up to the 2nd anniversary the charge is 9% of the amount repaid; up to the 3rd anniversary the charge is 8% of the amount repaid; up to the 4th anniversary the charge is 7% of the amount repaid; up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 6% of the amount repaid; 12", "177": "up to the 6th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid; up to the 7th anniversary the charge is 4% of the amount repaid; up to the 8th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid; up to the 9th anniversary the charge is 2% of the amount repaid; up to the 15th anniversary the charge is 1% of the amount repaid; after 15th anniversary is no charge. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this you may incur an early repayment charge. if you wish to repay your loan early, we suggest contacting more 2 life for a redemption statement. 4.6 exemption from early repayment charges no early repayment charge will be made if: you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies; after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your new property does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria; the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage to the property; you make a voluntary partial repayment; the lifetime mortgage is repaid by remaining borrower within 3 years of the death or requirement for long term care of first borrower; the cash faciity is withdrawn; or you downsize to a lower value property and are requested to make a partial repayment. 4.7 voluntary partial early repayments more 2 life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge provided: the total amount of voluntary payments does not exceed 10% of the total cash advanced per annum; minimum payment of 50, unlimited instalments. please note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, the early repayment charge will attach. where you do make partial repayments this will reduce the level of loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up. any unused 10% annual allowance cannot be carried forward to subsequent periods. if you plan to move house, as set out above, and a partial repayment is required due to your new home being of lower value no early repayment charge will be payable. 13", "178": "5. what are the advantages? 5.1 you will have an immediate lump sum of 50,000.00 to use as you wish, unless you have used the funds to clear existing debts. you also have a cash facility of 50,000.00. 5.2 you retain ownership of your home. 5.3 you can port your loan to new property, provided that the onward property is acceptable to more 2 life. 5.4 more 2 life does not expect repayment of this loan during your lifetime (unless/until the surviving borrower is in long term care which brings the contract to an end) and you do not have to make payments whilst you are living at the property. you have the option to repay in full, should you so wish, which will be subject to the early repayment calculation as set out above. 5.5 subject to you complying with the terms and conditions, more 2 life offers a no-negative equity guarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the property, even if the level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in your home. 14", "179": "6. what are the disadvantages? 6.1 means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits may be affected. you should therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. 6.2 the loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in your home over time, where no voluntary repayments are made, particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of your home. 6.3 further loans against the property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by more 2 life while its loan is still in existence. a further advance from more 2 life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in your property. 6.4 if you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt the property can be repossessed and the no negative equity guarantee may be revoked. 6.5 this is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the property is repossessed). for your peace of mind, more 2 life have set a maximum figure which can be charged of 5,341.23, this allows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging. the calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of the offer. 15", "180": "7. conclusions: risk -v- reward it is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the risks of entering into this agreement. risk 7.1 if you seriously breach the terms and conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the property could be repossessed and sold to repay the loan. this may incur early repayment charges. if you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by more 2 life as a result of the breaches. more 2 life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach. repossession would always be a matter of last resort. 7.2 if you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances. further additional secured borrowing from more 2 life is not guaranteed. 7.3 if you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you wished to re-mortgage with another lender. 7.4 if the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump sum that you have taken. 7.5 if you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments) , particularly if the value of the property does not go up over time. this means that you would not be able to leave this property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the property have been sold. 7.6 eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. 7.7 any existing charge secured against the property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion. 7.8 if your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt secured against your home. you should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the best course of action for you. reward: 7.9 you will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use. 7.10 there is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home (provided there are no breaches of the terms and conditions). 7.11 you can potentially port this mortgage to a new property if you want to move house. 16", "181": "8. what happens next? 8.1 please read and consider this report carefully, together with the mortgage offer and the terms and conditions. if you are willing to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive to outweigh the risks involved the next step is to arrange a signing appointment to complete the required documentation. if you are still unsure, or we can clarify any aspect for you, please do not hesitate to contact natasha wakefield. you should keep this report for future reference. 8.2 appointment in order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully. it is a matter of law that the deed must be executed in the physical presence of an independent person. the equity release council (\"erc\") guidelines require this to be a solicitor. the attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation and not to provide you with any legal advice. legal advice is provided by us within this mortgage report. if you have any questions or queries arising from this report, please direct these to natasha wakefield in advance of the appointment. in preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed document checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are available. if any documents are missing, please contact natasha wakefield prior to the appointment so we can arrange for any replacement documents to be sent to you in readiness. if the missing documents are those in your care and control, but are unavailable, please contact natasha wakefield so that we can discuss how best to proceed. we anticipate that the solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. the solicitor will need to verify your identity at the appointment and take copies of the documentation provided. please ensure you have: valid photographic signature identification: i.e passport, driving licence, national identity card and address verification: i.e bank statement; utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current council tax bill naming each borrower. in order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your exact bank details otherwise the banking system will reject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you. in order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment. very occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing appointment. to minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via skype or facetime. if you are not able to access this via your own (or a family/friends) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local solicitor who will charge 5 per document witnessing fee. if this is required, we will notify you and provide our skype/facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. 8.3 cost of the solicitor appointment the costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting. if you cancel or fail to attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to be met. if you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency. 8.4 identification we must provide a guarantee of your identity to more 2 life at the point of requesting completion. to be able to give this guarantee we will need valid photographic identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport. if you do not have such identity verification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity. please see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories. please contact natasha wakefield to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required guarantee. additionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly. if there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your birth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). if there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: your most recent council tax invoice and a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a dwp pensions letter. 17", "182": "if you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or discrepancy to resolve please let natasha wakefield in advance of the signing appointment, so that we can instruct your attending solicitor to obtain all necessary documentation. 8.5 next steps once we have received your signed documentation we endeavour to send all documentation to more 2 lifes solicitor within 2 working days by guaranteed next day special delivery. we can only forward these documents when all required conditions have been satisfied and all documentation received. please ensure the document checklist has been fully completed. on a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately 15 working days from this point. this timescale is only an estimate and is not guaranteed. as such, we strongly recommend that you do not commit funds until we confirm completion is taking place, which we will do by telephone in advance. if your case has any additional elements we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, because we are often waiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and impossible to guarantee. natasha wakefield will keep you up to date with progress on your case. on a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately three to four weeks from this point. we will endeavour to secure the earliest possible completion date (if that is what you would like) but if there is any particular urgency attaching to your case, or significance around a date (including a need to delay) please inform natasha wakefield so that we can do our best to achieve your expectations. 8.6 completion arrangements more 2 lifes solicitors enact will contact us with a completion date once final checks have been carried out by the team there. we will telephone you to go through the final completion figures and to give you a final opportunity to change your mind. please contact natasha wakefield if you are likely to be unavailable to discuss your case by telephone, at any time during the next four weeks (on standard cases). if we cannot reach you, we will delay completion until such time as we can speak to you. if this is likely to cause you a problem, or if you have any queries about this, please let us know as soon as possible. 8.7 receipt of funds on completion day more 2 lifes solicitors will send your funds to us. sometimes funds are not received until late afternoon and, in such circumstances, we may not be able to process the funds within banking hours. we will always process your funds on the next working day when we receive funds too late to process on the same day. please contact natasha wakefield if the funds are not in your account within 48 hours (working days) of completion taking place. please ensure that you have read and understand all sections of your mortgage report and mortgage offer. if you have any queries regarding any aspects of your equity release please do not hesitate to contact your case handler natasha

conditions and mortgage conditions (2019 ed.) has been selected as the most suitable product for your requirements. this is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home. 1.2 amount of loan the maximum amount that more 2 life are willing to lend is 318,000.00. at the date of completion, you will receive a lump sum of 50,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). you will also have access to a cash facility of 50,000.00. more 2 life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the property as security for this loan. you can apply to more 2 life for additional borrowing. more 2 life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. 1.3 cash facility following completion, you will have access to a cash facility of 50,000.00. you will not be charged interest on the cash facility until you draw funds from it. when you do withdraw funds, more 2 life will charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher or lower than the original rate in this offer of 6.62%. please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the cash facility. you can apply at any time, to more 2 life to borrow any amount within your cash facility subject to a minimum amount of 2,000.00. please note that more 2 life does have the right to withdraw the cash facility at any time, as set out in section 5 of the offer. 1.4 interest the interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 6.62%. interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly. you are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. unpaid interest will be added to the loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (rolling up). the interest continues to roll up, at the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid. over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments). if house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the property will be eroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the property. the requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the property has been abandoned. this will either be because you have died, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the property. please note that interest continues to roll up until the mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the property); it will not stop just because you are no longer living there. section 8 of the offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. the loan period may be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest which accrues. the annual percentage rate is 7%. 1.5 inheritance protection more 2 life offers inheritance protection. this allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the property, but ultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow. you have opted not to protect any of the equity in the property. please note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to opt for inheritance protection will have been lost. if you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would like to protect a proportion of the property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to completion.", "192": "1.6 no negative equity guarantee. more 2 life provides a no negative equity guarantee. this means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or your estate owe more than the value of your home, more 2 life will not seek to recover any further amount than the proceeds of sale. this guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the terms and conditions of the plan. for example, keeping the property in good repair and condition. the guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by more 2 life. the guarantee only applies when the property is sold to repay the loan. it will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the property and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your property will reduce the available equity for a new property. all of the lenders that belong to the equity release council offer a no-negative equity guarantee which means that if the level of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any shortfall. however, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee. this is not specified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so i cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything). the downside is that if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not need. however, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable. there is not currently an equity release council approved product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which meets council standards, there is no alternative. if you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your financial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you. 1.7 once the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of the loan you are taking, versus the value of your property. compound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future). 1.8 moving house it is possible to move to a different property, under the terms of the scheme (please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions) provided that the property you want to move to is acceptable to more 2 life. however, this is not guaranteed. examples of where more 2 life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another property might include a flat, where the lease does not have enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the property is of non-standard construction. if more 2 life are agreeable to porting your mortgage to a new property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. if you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve more 2 life from the outset. the solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with more 2 lifes solicitors at all stages to ensure that more 2 life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend. only once more 2 life have confirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to exchange. you must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new property without more 2 lifes consent. if your proposed new property is not acceptable to more 2 life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract an early repayment charge. if your proposed new home does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge. you should always obtain more 2 life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in the event that this is not possible 1.9 sale of part of your property if you are seeking to sell part of your property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell more 2 life and seek more 2 lifes prior consent. if the sale of part of your property reduces the value of your property you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. 1.10 taxation on the loan the loan is tax-free under present legislation. ", "193": "whilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and governments can apply any new rules retrospectively. if such a change occurred, you may have to pay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax position. however, this is unlikely.", "194": "2. what will it cost to set up? 2.1 financial advisers fee we have been advised by viva retirement solutions that fees of 750.00 have been agreed between you. we will pay this amount directly to viva retirement solutions from your completion funds. 2.2 legal fees you are responsible for equilaws fees, disbursements and vat of 699.00, as detailed in our initial estimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for extra work, as applicable. 2.3 other costs more 2 life and/or their solicitors may, from time to time, have additional disbursement costs. we are not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is provided with the intended completion date. we will always make you aware of any additional disbursements as soon as we are made aware. ", "195": "3. your obligations and what you have agreed to do 3.1 borrowing you have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) out of the equity release funds and cannot use your home as security for any further borrowing, unless more 2 life gives its written permission. 3.2 who can live in the property? only the people named in the mortgage offer are allowed to live at the property. 3.3 moving a new person into the property if you want somebody else to move into your home, you must seek more 2 lifes authority to do so. the new occupier will be required to sign the lender's occupier's waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees) before they move in. if you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan in the name of the proposed joint owners. if more 2 life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to repay part of the loan (without early repayment charge). 3.4 residence this must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. if you are planning to leave your property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform more 2 life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so. it is important that you do this so that more 2 life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges. you must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the property. usually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the property empty for 30 days or more. 3.5 you can live in the property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage conditions). please carefully read more 2 lifes terms and conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions (including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the terms and conditions). 3.6 right to inspect the property more 2 life is entitled to inspect the property periodically to ensure that the terms and conditions of the loan are being complied with. more 2 life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of emergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse. this is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is set out at section 10 in the terms and conditions. 3.7 repair & maintenance you have agreed to keep the property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting it fall into disrepair. if more 2 life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done within the time stipulated or more 2 life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it. if you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage and interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up. please also note that if you do not keep the property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out the repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee. 3.8 insurance you must keep the property fully insured, by a company approved by more 2 life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to", "196": "restore the property, to its present condition. if it is damaged or destroyed the policy should include cover demolition, site clearance and architects plans to rebuild the property. the reinstatement sum insured as assessed by more 2 lifes valuer and must be no less than 400,000.00. we will require sight of the new insurance policy prior to completion, to enable us to demonstrate that it meets more 2 lifes requirements. more 2 life should be noted on your buildings insurance as per the terms and conditions and you may need to send more 2 life a copy of your buildings insurance each year, so that they can check that you have the necessary insurance cover. if the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. a copy will be required for completion, please send to us, if not already done so. if you do not insure your property more 2 life will do this for you but will re-charge you for the cost of the insurance to you. you must pay these sums once notified, should you fail to do so more 2 life will charge interest on the amount outstanding. these costs will fall outside of the no negative equity guarantee. you should also note that any insurance arranged by more 2 life will be suitable for more 2 lifes purposes but many not be suitable for you. we recommend that you always source your own index linked insurance. if an insurable event e.g. a fire, occurs you must immediately inform more 2 life. any monies paid under the insurance policy to you must be used to repair and make good the loss and damage or repay the total debt owing. 3.9 impact on your estate you should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate which you are able to leave to them on your death. it is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the property to move into long term care. they will need to notify more 2 life of this event and be aware of more 2 lifes requirements regarding repayment of the loan. 3.10 legal notice, orders or proposals effecting your property. you must inform more 2 life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the property. 3.11 alterations to the property you must seek more 2 lifes permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the property (e.g., new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations approval) this is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from more 2 life in principle as, if the lender refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work. lenders do not usually withhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects. if you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as green deal) you must first obtain the written permission of more 2 life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the property, which is not allowed by more 2 life). 3.12 acquiring additional land adjoining the property if you buy or acquire any land next to the property please notify more 2 life. more 2 life may require you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land. this is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the property (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions. 3.13 renting out the property you cannot rent out the property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself. if you wish to do so, please contact more 2 life. if more 2 life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a buy to let loan. your financial adviser will be able to assist you. 3.14 business use you cannot use your home for business purposes. if you wish to do so you must contact more 2 life to seek its permission.", "197": "3.15 impact on benefits receipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits. if you think you may be entitled to any such benefits, or you receive means- tested benefits already, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore your options in advance of taking up this equity release.", "198": "4. when does the loan have to be repaid? 4.1 the loan contract ends when: the last owner of the property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of care in the terms and conditions, which you should read carefully); or if you purchase another property and the loan cannot be ported; or the property is permanently abandoned; or if you become bankrupt; or if you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the terms and conditions. the amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by more 2 life (for example repair costs). the term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 15 years. this does not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase. 4.2 impact of loan ending due to death or long term care if the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then more 2 life may request medical or other specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). the term will also end on death. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). 4.3 sale of the property you or your attorney (if you have appointed one under a power of attorney) or personal representatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the property. if the property is not sold within 12 months more 2 life may take over conduct of the sale. this would usually be if more 2 life perceived no progress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances. by signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint more 2 life under a power of attorney in relation to the property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. that said, if you are still capable of dealing with your own affairs, or have your own attorney, more 2 life would not usually get involved. however, it does mean that more 2 life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the property, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the property at the end of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so. 4.4 bankruptcy and/or breach of material contract terms the loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the terms and conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in the terms and conditions. please note that early repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances. 4.5 early repayment charges. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the terms and conditions. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this prior to the 15 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge. the early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date: up to the 1st anniversary the charge is 10% of the amount repaid; up to the 2nd anniversary the charge is 9% of the amount repaid; up to the 3rd anniversary the charge is 8% of the amount repaid; up to the 4th anniversary the charge is 7% of the amount repaid; up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 6% of the amount repaid;", "199": "up to the 6th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid; up to the 7th anniversary the charge is 4% of the amount repaid; up to the 8th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid; up to the 9th anniversary the charge is 2% of the amount repaid; up to the 15th anniversary the charge is 1% of the amount repaid; after 15th anniversary is no charge. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this you may incur an early repayment charge. if you wish to repay your loan early, we suggest contacting more 2 life for a redemption statement. 4.6 exemption from early repayment charges no early repayment charge will be made if: you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies; after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your new property does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria; the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage to the property; you make a voluntary partial repayment; the lifetime mortgage is repaid by remaining borrower within 3 years of the death or requirement for long term care of first borrower; the cash faciity is withdrawn; or you downsize to a lower value property and are requested to make a partial repayment. 4.7 voluntary partial early repayments more 2 life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge provided: the total amount of voluntary payments does not exceed 10% of the total cash advanced per annum; minimum payment of 50, unlimited instalments. please note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, the early repayment charge will attach. where you do make partial repayments this will reduce the level of loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up. any unused 10% annual allowance cannot be carried forward to subsequent periods. if you plan to move house, as set out above, and a partial repayment is required due to your new home being of lower value no early repayment charge will be payable.", "200": "5. what are the advantages? 5.1 you will have an immediate lump sum of 50,000.00 to use as you wish, unless you have used the funds to clear existing debts. you also have a cash facility of 50,000.00. 5.2 you retain ownership of your home. 5.3 you can port your loan to new property, provided that the onward property is acceptable to more 2 life. 5.4 more 2 life does not expect repayment of this loan during your lifetime (unless/until the surviving borrower is in long term care which brings the contract to an end) and you do not have to make payments whilst you are living at the property. you have the option to repay in full, should you so wish, which will be subject to the early repayment calculation as set out above. 5.5 subject to you complying with the terms and conditions, more 2 life offers a no-negative equity guarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the property, even if the level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in your home. ", "201": "6. what are the disadvantages? 6.1 means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits may be affected. you should therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. 6.2 the loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in your home over time, where no voluntary repayments are made, particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of your home. 6.3 further loans against the property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by more 2 life while its loan is still in existence. a further advance from more 2 life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in your property. 6.4 if you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt the property can be repossessed and the no negative equity guarantee may be revoked. 6.5 this is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the property is repossessed). for your peace of mind, more 2 life have set a maximum figure which can be charged of 5,341.23, this allows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging. the calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of the offer.", "202": "7. conclusions: risk -v- reward it is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the risks of entering into this agreement. risk 7.1 if you seriously breach the terms and conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the property could be repossessed and sold to repay the loan. this may incur early repayment charges. if you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by more 2 life as a result of the breaches. more 2 life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach. repossession would always be a matter of last resort. 7.2 if you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances. further additional secured borrowing from more 2 life is not guaranteed. 7.3 if you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you wished to re-mortgage with another lender. 7.4 if the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump sum that you have taken. 7.5 if you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments) , particularly if the value of the property does not go up over time. this means that you would not be able to leave this property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the property have been sold. 7.6 eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. 7.7 any existing charge secured against the property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion. 7.8 if your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt secured against your home. you should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the best course of action for you. reward: 7.9 you will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use. 7.10 there is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home (provided there are no breaches of the terms and conditions). 7.11 you can potentially port this mortgage to a new property if you want to move house.", "203": "8. what happens next? 8.1 please read and consider this report carefully, together with

bank statement; utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current council tax bill naming each borrower. in order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your exact bank details otherwise the banking system will reject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you. in order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment. very occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing appointment. to minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via skype or facetime. if you are not able to access this via your own (or a family/friends) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local solicitor who will charge 5 per document witnessing fee. if this is required, we will notify you and provide our skype/facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. 8.3 cost of the solicitor appointment the costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting. if you cancel or fail to attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to be met. if you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency. 8.4 identification we must provide a guarantee of

have such identity verification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity. please see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories. please contact natasha wakefield to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required guarantee.

checklist has been fully completed. on a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will be

is taking place, which we will do by telephone in advance. if your case has any additional elements we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, because we are often waiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and impossible to guarantee. natasha wakefield will keep you up to date with progress on your case. on a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately three to four weeks from this point. we will

need to delay) please inform natasha wakefield so that we can do our best to achieve your expectations. 8.6 completion arrangements more 2 lifes solicitors enact will contact us with a completion date

more 2 lifes solicitors will send your funds to us. sometimes funds are not received until late afternoon and, in such circumstances, we may not be able to process the funds within banking hours. we

"lifetime mortgage offer 3. what is a lifetime mortgage? important information from the financial conduct authority: a lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or a regular income. the amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the sale of your home after death. if you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death of the last borrower. any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries. if you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. otherwise you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. any money left over belongs to you. if you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. again, any money left over belongs to you. if you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs to move into long-term care, you dont usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either dies or moves into long-term care or another property. if you decide that you simply dont want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount you owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do. section 13 of this offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage. some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment this means you borrow a lump sum which is invested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. if this happens the full details of the investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents together. 4. what you have told us you want an offer for the flexi choice plan. your details: male 83 years female 80 years your property has been valued at: 795,000.00 construction: standard you want a cash facility of 100,000.00. you want to receive an initial advance of 50,000.00. no fees have been added to this amount, but the fees you need to pay are shown in section 11. for details of any insurance charges, see section 12. the remainder of your cash facility that is not drawn down at the start of your mortgage is subject to a minimum draw down amount of 2,000 each time (or the full amount of the remaining facility if less than 2,000), and is also subject to the conditions described in section 5. changes to any of the information you have given us, could alter the information in this offer. if this is the case ask for a revised offer. fc v1.30 1121 page 3 of 15", "216": "lifetime mortgage offer 5. description of this mortgage this offer is for a flexi choice plan provided by more 2 life limited. it provides you with a cash lump sum at the start of the loan and a cash facility which you may be able to draw cash from after your initial lump sum loan completion, subject to a minimum withdrawal of 2,000 or withdrawal of the remaining facility if less than 2,000. you do not have to make any payments during the life of this lifetime mortgage. you can apply direct to more 2 life limited for further borrowing of the remaining amount of this facility without further financial advice. this borrowing is not guaranteed and will be based on the terms available from more 2 life limited at the time. the remaining cash facility will be reduced or removed: if the product is no longer offered by the lender, the lender is no longer in business, rothesay life plc are no longer funding the lender, or to comply with the regulations governing either the lender or rothesay life plc if, the total of (i) the amount outstanding under your lifetime mortgage (including your initial lump sum, any subsequent cash advances, accrued interest and any charges you have incurred) plus (ii) any unused part of your cash facility, exceeds the amount we would agree to lend to a new borrower (of equivalent age) in comparable circumstances. if the facility is fully withdrawn for this reason, you can repay your lifetime mortgage in full without incurring early repayment charges if any of the events of default specified in the loan and mortgage conditions as causing the agreement to terminate and making the balance immediately due and payable has occurred or have failed to maintain the property in good condition. if you are subject to an undischarged bankruptcy or individual voluntary arrangement (iva) or have been discharged from bankruptcy or an iva if you own the property as tenants in common, where one applicant dies, the remaining borrower cannot access any unutilised cash facility when they are not the sole beneficiary of the deceaseds share of the property. any such further borrowing will be based on the interest rate available from more 2 life limited at the time of application for this product taking account of your then age and the value of your property relative to your total outstanding balance and any unutilised cash facility. the interest rate applicable to such further borrowing may be more or less than your initial interest rate. the offer that we give you at the time of any cash advance will set out the interest rate for that cash advance. this lifetime mortgage can only be arranged for either one or two people between the ages of 55 - 84, based on the age of the youngest applicant, who own and live permanently in the property which is subject to the lifetime mortgage. if there are any other outstanding mortgages or charges at the time the loan is taken out, you will be required to use the lifetime mortgage to clear these loans. as part of the completion process our solicitors will redeem them with the proceeds from the loan. interest is charged at a fixed rate of 6.62% on the initial advance until receipt by more 2 life limited of all monies due. the interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly, meaning the interest rolls up with interest being charged on that interest, paid when you repay your loan. see section 8 for example. any cash advances will be subject to the new interest rate payable at the time which will be set out in the offer that we give you for that cash advance, and will be based on your then age and the value of your property relative to your total outstanding balance and any unutilised cash facility, and which will then be fixed for the lifetime of the loan. we have based this offer on an estimated term of 15 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 15 years. if you are still living in your home at the end of 15 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run. the loan, accrued interest and charges that may be due, become payable out of the proceeds from the sale of your home under the following circumstances; on your death, or (if joint borrowers) on the death of the last borrower. if you move home and transferring this lifetime mortgage to the new property does not meet our lending conditions. if you move into residential or long-term care on the grounds of medical or other specialist advice. any money left over would be paid to you or your beneficiaries. the maximum amount you can borrow is 318,000.00. however, if you change the loan amount currently requested, the rate of interest may also change. if you require additional funds you may apply for further secured borrowing subject to availability - see section 14 for details. fc v1.30 1121 page 4 of 15", "217": "lifetime mortgage offer 6. benefits this lifetime mortgage will

property. if the new property is of a lower value, we may ask you to repay part of the amount outstanding on the lifetime mortgage. 5. if you move out of your home into long-term care or residential care your home must be sold and the lifetime mortgage repaid. early repayment charges do not apply if this happens - they are only payable if you choose to repay your lifetime mortgage early. section 13 of this offer tells you when they are payable. 6. if you want someone else to move into your home to live with you, for example; upon marriage/the formation of a civil partnership, or where someone acts as your carer, you must first get more 2 life limited to agree before they move in. otherwise this will breach the terms of your mortgage. any persons that are currently residing at the property and are not party to the loan may have to sign a waiver in order to continue living in the property. 7. you must keep your home in good repair. if you do not keep your home in good repair, more 2 life limited has the right to inspect the property and get the repairs done, but they will tell you first if they intend to do this. the cost of any repairs that more 2 life limited has to arrange will be added to the amount you owe on this lifetime mortgage. where such costs are not able to be reclaimed on the sale of the property, they may be excluded from the no negative equity guarantee (see section 6). 8. taking out this mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits, and may also affect your tax position. tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need further advice you should contact hm revenue & customs, the pension service, benefits agency or your local citizens advice bureau. 9. the property must currently be

(including drawings of your remaining cash facility) will be based on the prevailing lending criteria. the amount of your cash facility is not guaranteed and the facility will be reduced or withdrawn

gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldterms and conditions at section 1 paragraph 7). provided that the property you want to move to is acceptable to more 2 life. however, this is not guaranteed. examples of where more 2 life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another property might include a flat, where the lease does not have enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the property is of non-standard construction. if more 2 life is agreeable to porting (ie, transferring) your mortgage to a new property, and your planned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. if you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve more 2 life from the outset. the solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with more 2 lifes solicitors at all stages to ensure that more 2 life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and is willing to (continue to) lend. only once more 2 life has confirmed that it is satisfied with the new property, will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to exchange. you must not progress the transaction to a stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new property without more 2 lifes consent. if your proposed new property is acceptable to more 2 life and you decide to repay the loan, you may attract an early repayment charge. if your proposed new home does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge. you should always obtain more 2 life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in the event that this is not possible. 1.8 sale of part of the property if you are seeking to sell part of the property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell more 2 life and seek more 2 lifes prior consent in accordance with part 2, section 4.13 of the terms and conditions. if the sale of part of the property reduces its value, it is likely that you may be required to repay some of the loan. 1.9 taxation on the loan the loan is tax-free under present legislation. whilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and governments can apply any new rules retrospectively. if such a change occurred, you may have to pay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax position. however, this is unlikely. what will it cost to set up? 2.1 financial advisers fee we have been advised by viva retirement solutions that fees of 750.00 have been agreed between you. we will pay this amount directly to viva retirement solutions from your completion funds. 2.2 legal fees you are responsible for equilaws fees, disbursements and vat of 699.00, as detailed in our initial estimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for extra work, as applicable.", "238": "6 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefield2.3 other costs more 2 life and/or their solicitors may, from time to time, have additional disbursement costs. we are not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is provided with the intended completion date. we will always make you aware of any additional disbursements

as per hmlr fee scale copy lease or other deed 3 each k15 2 each name os2 3 per title your obligations and what you have agreed to do 3.1 borrowing you have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) from the proceeds of the equity release funds and you cannot use the property as security for any further borrowing; unless more 2 life gives its written permission, which is unlikely. 3.2 who can live in the property? only the people named in the mortgage offer can live at the property, subject to the paragraph title \"moving a new person into the property\" below. 3.3 moving a new person into the property if you want somebody else to move into the property, you must seek more 2 lifes authority to do so. the new occupier will be required to sign more 2 life's occupier's waiver form and may require independent legal advice. you or the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees before they move in. please note that more 2 life states that, once this mortgage is completed, you cannot add another borrower. as such, if you wanted to change the ownership of the property, youd need to pay back more 2 life first (eg, by re-mortgaging) as a new person cannot be added to this particular mortgage. if you do this within the early repayment term, you will incur an early repayment penalty. 3.4 residence this must be your permanent residence (i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions). if you are planning to leave the property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform more 2 life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so in accordance with the terms and conditions. it is important that you do this so that more 2 life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges. you must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the property. usually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the property empty for 30 days or more. 3.5 you can live in the property for as long as you either want or need to (if you do not breach any of the mortgage conditions). please carefully read the terms and conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions (including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default.

(i.e that the property insurance is in the joint names of yourself and more 2 life equity release ltd). we will require sight of the new insurance policy immediately after completion, to enable us to check it meets more 2 lifes requirements. more 2 life may require you to produce a copy of your buildings insurance from time to time to check that you are adequately covered. if the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. a copy will be required for completion, and therefore please send it to us, if you have not already done so. if you do not insure the property, more 2 life will do this for you but will re-charge the cost of the insurance premium to you. you must pay these sums on demand and please be aware that the insurance will be to protect more 2 life's interest and therefore may not be suitable for your own requirements. we recommend that you always source your own suitable insurance and keep up to date with the premiums to avoid more 2 life stepping in. if an insurable event occurs (e.g. a fire or flood), you must immediately inform more 2 life. more 2 life has the right to negotiate with the insurer on your behalf. any monies paid under the insurance policy will be held by you on trust for more 2 life and must be used to make good the loss and damage. more 2 life can elect, acting reasonably, to use any proceeds of such a claim to reduce or repay the total debt owing, instead of rebuilding the property. it would be unlikely for more 2 life to do this, unless it was wholly impractical or impossible to facilitate the rebuild of the property. please review section 2, paragraphs 4.8 and 4.9 of the terms and conditions for further details. ", "240": "8 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefield3.9 impact on your estate you should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate which you are able to leave to them on your death. it is also likely that these persons will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the property to move into long term care. they will need to notify more 2 life of this event and be aware of more 2 lifes requirements regarding repayment of the loan. 3.10 legal notice, orders or proposals effecting the property. you must immediately inform more 2 life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the property. 3.11 alterations to the property you must seek more 2 life's permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the property (eg, new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations approval) this is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from more 2 life in principle as, if it refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work. lenders do not usually withhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects. if you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as green deal) you must first obtain the written permission of more 2 life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the property, which is not allowed by more 2 life). 3.12 acquiring additional land adjoining the property if you buy or acquire any land next to the property, please notify more 2 life. more 2 life may require you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land. this is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the property (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. please see section 2, paragraph 4.14 of the terms and conditions. 3.13 renting out the property you cannot rent out the property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself. if you wish to do so, please contact more 2 life to discuss your options. if more 2 life does not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a buy to let product. your financial adviser will be able to assist you and talk you through the costs of doing so. 3.14 business use you cannot use the property for business purposes. if you wish to do so you must contact more 2 life to seek its permission which may be refused. as such, if this is something that you are likely to want to do, you should speak to your financial adviser now to understand your options. 3.15 impact on benefits receipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits. if you think you may be entitled to any such benefits, or you receive means-tested benefits already, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore your options in advance of taking up this equity release. 3.16 special conditions imposed by more 2 life", "241": "9 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldthe following special conditions, that must be satisfied in order to complete your lifetime mortgage, have been imposed: noting er lender on buildings insurance it is a condition of the mortgage offer that more 2 life is noted as an interested party on your buildings insurance schedule. please contact your insurance provider to effect this change. once you have done so, please forward a copy of the insurance schedule to us in order to satisfy this requirement. when does the loan have to be repaid? 4.1 the loan contract ends if and when: the last owner of the property dies, goes into long-term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of payment date in the terms and conditions, which you should read carefully) and explains what is regarded as long-term care; or you purchase another property and the loan cannot be ported; or the property is permanently abandoned (please see the definition of payment date in the terms and conditions); or you are declared bankrupt; or you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in section 1, paragraph 9 terms & conditions the amount to repay will include the capital borrowed, plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by more 2 life (for example repair costs). the term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 8 of your mortgage offer is 15 years. this does not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase the longer it runs. 4.2 impact of loan ending due to death or long term care if the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then more 2 life may request medical or other specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused. the term will also end on the last borrower's death. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances, but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (again, usually when the property is sold). 4.3 sale of the property you or your attorney (if you have appointed one under a power of attorney) or personal representatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the property following the last borrower entering into long term care or dying. if the property is not sold within 12 months more 2 life may take over conduct of the sale. this would usually be if more 2 life perceived no progress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances. 4.4 bankruptcy and/or breach of material contract terms the loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the terms and conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in section 1, paragraph 9 and section 2, paragraph 4 of the terms and conditions, including being declared bankrupt. please note that early repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances. 4.5 early repayment charges. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the terms and conditions.", "242": "10 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldit is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this prior to the 15 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge. the early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date: up to the 1st anniversary the charge is 10% of the amount repaid; up to the 2nd anniversary the charge is 9% of the amount repaid; up to the 3rd anniversary the charge is 8% of the amount repaid; up to the 4th anniversary the charge is 7% of the amount repaid; up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 6% of the amount repaid; up to the 6th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid; up to the 7th anniversary the charge is 4% of the amount repaid; up to the 8th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid; up to the 9th anniversary the charge is 2% of the amount repaid; up to the 15th anniversary the charge is 1% of the amount repaid; after 15th anniversary is no charge. 4.6 exemption from early repayment charges no early repayment penalty will be charged if: you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies; after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your new property does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria; the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage to the property; you make a voluntary partial repayment; the lifetime mortgage is repaid by remaining borrower within 3 years of the death or requirement for long term care of first borrower; the cash faciity is withdrawn; or you downsize to a lower value property and are requested to make a partial repayment. 4.7 voluntary partial early repayments more 2 life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge: maximum payment of 10% of the total cash advanced within each 12 month period following completion; and minimum payment of 50; and maximum of twelve payments in a 12 month period please note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, an early repayment charge will apply (if this is within the early repayment term). where you do make partial repayments, it will reduce the level of loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up over time. if you intend to make a voluntary partial repayment, please ensure that you contact more 2 life before you make it. any proportion of the permitted voluntary partial repayments amount that is unused cannot be carried forward into the next 12-month period.", "243": "11 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldwhat are the advantages? 5.1 you will have an immediate lump sum of 50,000.00 to use as you wish, minus any retention, unless you have used the funds to clear existing debts. 5.2 you retain ownership of the property. 5.3 you can port (ie, transfer) your loan to a new property, provided that the onward property is acceptable to more 2 life. if this is more than 5 years after the initial completion date, no early repayment penalty will apply if more 2 life does not accept the new property (or you decide not to transfer the loan to it). 5.4 more 2 life does not expect repayment of this loan during your lifetime (unless/until the surviving borrower is in long term care which brings the contract to an end). you have the option to repay in full, should you so wish, subject to the early repayment calculation as set out above. 5.5 subject to you complying with the terms and conditions, more 2 life offers a no-negative equity guarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the property, even if the level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in the property. what are the disadvantages? 6.1 means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits may be affected. you should therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. 6.2 the loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in the property over time, especially where no voluntary repayments are made, and particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of the property. 6.3 further loans against the property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by more 2 life while its loan is still in existence. a further advance from more 2 life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in the property. 6.4 if you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt, the property can be repossessed (see section 1, paragraph 9 of the terms and conditions). 6.5 this is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply, should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the property is repossessed). for your peace of mind, more 2 life has set a maximum figure which can be charged of 5,341.23, which allows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging. the calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of your mortgage offer.", "244": "12 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldconclusions: risk -v- reward it is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the risks of entering into this agreement. risk 7.1 if you seriously breach the terms and conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the property could be repossessed and sold to repay the loan. this may incur early repayment charges. if you are deemed to be in default, the no-negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by more 2 life as a result of the breaches. more 2 life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach. repossession would always be a matter of last resort. 7.2 if you move to a new house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on the circumstances. 7.3 further additional secured borrowing from more 2 life is not guaranteed. in addition, the drawdown facility can be removed without notice by more 2 life at any time without prior notice. 7.4 if you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty will apply if you wish to re-mortgage with another lender. 7.5 if the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump sum that you have taken, albeit unlikely. 7.6 if you do not make any voluntary interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the property in due course, particularly if the value of the property does not go up over time. this means that you would not be able to leave the property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the property has been sold. 7.7 eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely affected. 7.8 any existing charge secured against the property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion. 7.9 if your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt secured against the property, which is enforceable if you default by repossession. you should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the best course of action for you. reward: 7.10 you will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use. 7.11 there is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of the property (provided there are no material breaches of the terms and conditions). 7.12 you can potentially port this mortgage to a new property

documentation we will require you to complete our identity verification form. in order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your exact bank details otherwise the banking system will reject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you. in order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank

behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser viva retirement solutions, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.", "250": "equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine scheme you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges if you have any secured loans, overdrafts or mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your equity release. please do not cancel any direct debits/standing orders until after completion. any overpayment made will be refunded by your current lender. if you cancel your direct debit/standing order before completion it may cause the amount repaid to be insufficient to clear the existing debt and this would then prevent your equity release lender from securing their charge over the property. this is in breach of their terms and conditions. fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all- inclusive fee of 699. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight- forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds.", "251": "disbursements disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\"

fraudsters over the last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us informing you first. and finally if you sense that something might be wrong in a communication to you from us then it probably is!", "256": "equilaw limited - terms of business about us equilaw is a

jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and

unable to accept payment by credit card unless in exceptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and

", "262": "1. do i have to send in my title deeds? if your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or directly (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. ", "263": "2.i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4.do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9.why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me?

advised us on the nature effects and implications of our entering into the equity release plan. 3.we have read a copy of our solicitors equity release report dated and we are satisfied with the contents therein and fully understand the same. 4.we are not suffering from any physical or mental condition that prevents me/us from understanding the advice i/we have had or will receive from my/our

proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from viva retirement solutions and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you ", "276": "have

", "290": "2 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldthe objective of this report is to identify the key elements of your chosen lifetime mortgage, to advise you of your legal obligations and the effect of the mortgage on you and the property. in term of suitability for your needs, you must rely entirely on the financial advice and guidance provided by your financial adviser or the plan providers representative. equilaw cannot give you any financial advice regarding the plans suitability for your circumstances and requirements, now or in the future. if you are not absolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your financial adviser before proceeding further. if you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you have sought further financial advice; from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment may not exceed the interest charged on this product. any existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the property must be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release. if you do not intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding further. unless we hear from you to the contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity release funds paid to you on completion. additionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the equity release. the effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against the property. please ensure that you have reviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances. if this applies in your case, you will find details in the special conditions section of this report. you may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance tax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees. the rules and regulations relating to gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. the equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose, without careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. please also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life. further information and guidance is produced by age uk and can be found at www.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information-guides-and-factsheets/. it is important to review and/or make a will in the context of taking out an equity release plan. making a will can achieve significant savings in tax and costs of winding up your estate. it also means that your assets will be distributed in accordance with your wishes and not as provided for by the general laws of intestacy. you should also consider making a lasting power of attorney, which can safeguard your position and ensure that your wishes are carried out in relation to the property, health and finances in the event that you become incapable of handling these decisions personally in the future. if you would like to discuss these matters, please let me know and i will put you in touch with an appropriate specialist. you should read this report, together with the mortgage deed, the loan agreement and the more 2 life terms and conditions (hereinafter referred to as \"the terms and conditions\") before committing to the scheme. if there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact natasha wakefield or your financial adviser, david cole, before you proceed. you should not go ahead with the scheme until you are satisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy with it. fraud warning we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly. if you receive any telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number which can be found on our letterhead. ", "291": "3 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldwhat is the equity release scheme? 1.1 product type following advice from your financial adviser, david cole, more 2 life flexi choice plan lifetime mortgage - lifetime general loan conditions and mortgage conditions (2019 ed.) has been selected as the most suitable product for your requirements. this is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of the property. 1.2 amount of loan the maximum amount that more 2 life is willing to lend is 318,000.00. at the date of completion, you will receive a lump sum of 50,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial adviser fees). you will also have access to a cash reserve of 50,000.00. more 2 life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the property as security for this loan. you can apply to more 2 life for additional borrowing. more 2 life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. 1.3 cash facility following completion, you will have access to a cash facility of 50,000.00. you will not be charged interest on the cash facility until you draw funds from it. when you do withdraw funds, more 2 life will charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher or lower than the original rate in this offer of 6.62%. please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the cash facility. you can apply at any time, to more 2 life to borrow any amount within your cash facility subject to a minimum amount of 2,000.00. please note that more 2 life does have the right to withdraw the cash facility at any time, as set out in part 1, s 2.4 of the terms and conditions and section 5 of your mortgage offer. if you have used all of your cash facility, you can apply to more 2 life for additional borrowing. more 2 life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. you have asked for an initial advance of 50,000.00 which will be released as a lump sum on completion, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). more 2 life will register a first and only legal charge (ie, mortgage) against the title of 86 overslade lane, rugby, warwickshire, cv22 6ef (the property) as security for this loan.", "292": "4 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefield1.4 interest the interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 6.62%. interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly. the annual percentage rate is 7.0%. you are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. unpaid interest will be added to the loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (rolling up). the interest continues to roll up, at the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid. over a long period of time this can reach high levels especially if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments. if house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the property will be eroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against its value. the requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the property has been abandoned. this will either be because you have died, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live there. please note that interest continues to roll up until the mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the property); it will not stop just because you are no longer living there. section 8 of your mortgage offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. the loan period may be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest which accrues. 1.5 no negative equity guarantee. more 2 life provides a no negative equity guarantee. this means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage, you or your estate owe more than the value of the property, more 2 life will not seek to recover any further amount than the proceeds of sale. this guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the terms and conditions of the plan; for example, keeping the property in good repair and condition. as such, if more 2 life has had to undertake repairs on your behalf those costs (and interest) would fall outside of the no negative equity guarantee. the guarantee only applies when the property is sold to repay the loan. it will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the property and repay the loan, or if you wish to move to a new house, because the total debt secured against the property will reduce the available equity for a new property. it would also not apply if the property is sold below its(reasonable) market value. all of the lenders that belong to the equity release council offer a no-negative equity guarantee which means that if the level of the loan outstrips the value of the property when it is sold, more 2 life cannot pursue you or your estate for any shortfall. however, there is very likely to be a cost built into the loan in return for offering this guarantee. this is not specified anywhere by more 2 life, or broken down, so i cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything). the downside is that if the property's value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not need. however, if the loan does outstrip the property's value, you may find the guarantee very valuable. there is not currently an equity release council approved product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which meets council standards, there is no alternative. if you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your financial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you. 1.6 once the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of the loan you are taking, versus the value of the property. compound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future). 1.7 moving house it is possible to move to a different property, under the terms of the scheme (please see more 2 lifes ", "293": "5 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldterms and conditions at section 1 paragraph 7). provided that the property you want to move to is acceptable to more 2 life. however, this is not guaranteed. examples of where more 2 life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another property might include a flat, where the lease does not have enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the property is of non-standard construction. if more 2 life is agreeable to porting (ie, transferring) your mortgage to a new property, and your planned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. if you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve more 2 life from the outset. the solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with more 2 lifes solicitors at all stages to ensure that more 2 life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and is willing to (continue to) lend. only once more 2 life has confirmed that it is satisfied with the new property, will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to exchange. you must not progress the transaction to a stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new property without more 2 lifes consent. if your proposed new property is acceptable to more 2 life and you decide to repay the loan, you may attract an early repayment charge. if your proposed new home does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge. you should always obtain more 2 life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in the event that this is not possible. 1.8 sale of part of the property if you are seeking to sell part of the property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell more 2 life and seek more 2 lifes prior consent in accordance with part 2, section 4.13 of the terms and conditions. if the sale of part of the property reduces its value, it is likely that you may be required to repay some of the loan. 1.9 taxation on the loan the loan is tax-free under present legislation. whilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and governments can apply any new rules retrospectively. if such a change occurred, you may have to pay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax position. however, this is unlikely. what will it cost to set up? 2.1 financial advisers fee we have been advised by viva retirement solutions that fees of 750.00 have been agreed between you. we will pay this amount directly to viva retirement solutions from your completion funds. 2.2 legal fees you are responsible for equilaws fees, disbursements and vat of 699.00, as detailed in our initial estimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for extra work, as applicable.", "294": "6 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefield2.3 other costs more 2 life and/or their solicitors may, from time to time, have additional disbursement costs. we are not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is provided with the intended completion date. we will always make you aware of any additional disbursements as soon as we are made aware. the costs can be as follows (unless this is a purchase or first registration):- possible disbursements (where they apply) registration fee for first registration variable as per hmlr fee scale copy lease or other deed 3 each k15 2 each name os2 3 per title your obligations and what you have agreed to do 3.1 borrowing you have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) from the proceeds of the equity release funds and you cannot use the property as security for any further borrowing; unless more 2 life gives its written permission, which is unlikely. 3.2 who can live in the property? only the people named in the mortgage offer can live at the property, subject to the paragraph title \"moving a new person into the property\" below. 3.3 moving a new person into the property if you want somebody else to move into the property, you must seek more 2 lifes authority to do so. the new occupier will be required to sign more 2 life's occupier's waiver form and may require independent legal advice. you or the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees before they move in. please note that more 2 life states that, once this mortgage is completed, you cannot add another borrower. as such, if you wanted to change the ownership of the property, youd need to pay back more 2 life first (eg, by re-mortgaging) as a new person cannot be added to this particular mortgage. if you do this within the early repayment term, you will incur an early repayment penalty. 3.4 residence this must be your permanent residence (i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions). if you are planning to leave the property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform more 2 life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so in accordance with the terms and conditions. it is important that you do this so that more 2 life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges. you must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the property. usually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the property empty for 30 days or more. 3.5 you can live in the property for as long as you either want or need to (if you do not breach any

(i.e that the property insurance is in the joint names of yourself and more 2 life equity release ltd). we will require sight of the new insurance policy immediately after completion, to enable us to check it meets more 2 lifes requirements. more 2 life may require you to produce a copy of your buildings insurance from time to time to check that you are adequately covered. if the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. a copy will be required for completion, and therefore please send it to us, if you have not already done so. if you do not insure the property, more 2 life will do this for you but will re-charge the cost of the insurance premium to you. you must pay these sums on demand and please be aware that the insurance will be to protect more 2 life's interest and therefore may not be suitable for your own requirements. we recommend that you always source your own suitable insurance and keep up to date with the premiums to avoid more 2 life stepping in. if an insurable event occurs (e.g. a fire or flood), you must immediately inform more 2 life. more 2 life has the right to negotiate with the insurer on your behalf. any monies paid under the insurance policy will be held by you on trust for more 2 life and must be used to make good the loss and damage. more 2 life can elect, acting reasonably, to use any proceeds of such a claim to reduce or repay the total debt owing, instead of rebuilding the property. it would be unlikely for more 2 life to do this, unless it was wholly impractical or impossible to facilitate the rebuild of the property. please review section 2, paragraphs 4.8 and 4.9 of the terms and conditions for further details. ", "296": "8 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefield3.9 impact on your estate you should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate which you are able to leave to them on your death. it is also likely that these persons will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the property to move into long term care. they will need to notify more 2 life of this event and be aware of more 2 lifes requirements regarding repayment of the loan. 3.10 legal notice, orders or proposals effecting the property. you must immediately inform more 2 life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the property. 3.11 alterations to the property you must seek more 2 life's permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the property (eg, new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations approval) this is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from more 2 life in principle as, if it refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work. lenders do not usually withhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects. if you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as green deal) you must first obtain the written permission of more 2 life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the property, which is not allowed by more 2 life). 3.12 acquiring additional land adjoining the property if you buy or acquire any land next to the property, please notify more 2 life. more 2 life may require you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land. this is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the property (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. please see section 2, paragraph 4.14 of the terms and conditions. 3.13 renting out the property you cannot rent out the property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself. if you wish to do so, please contact more 2 life to discuss your options. if more 2 life does not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a buy to let product. your financial adviser will be able to assist you and talk you through the costs of doing so. 3.14 business use you cannot use the property for business purposes. if you wish to do so you must contact more 2 life to seek its permission which may be refused. as such, if this is something that you are likely to want to do, you should speak to your financial adviser now to understand your options. 3.15 impact on benefits receipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits. if you think you may be entitled to any such benefits, or you receive means-tested benefits already, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore your options in advance of taking up this equity release. 3.16 special conditions imposed by more 2 life", "297": "9 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldthe following special conditions, that must be satisfied in order to complete your lifetime mortgage, have been imposed: noting er lender on buildings insurance it is a condition of the mortgage offer that more 2 life is noted as an interested party on your buildings insurance schedule. please contact your insurance provider to effect this change. once you have done so, please forward a copy of the insurance schedule to us in order to satisfy this requirement. when does the loan have to be repaid? 4.1 the loan contract ends if and when: the last owner of the property dies, goes into long-term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of payment date in the terms and conditions, which you should read carefully) and explains what is regarded as long-term care; or you purchase another property and the loan cannot be ported; or the property is permanently abandoned (please see the definition of payment date in the terms and conditions); or you are declared bankrupt; or you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in section 1, paragraph 9 terms & conditions the amount to repay will include the capital borrowed, plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by more 2 life (for example repair costs). the term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 8 of your mortgage offer is 15 years. this does not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase the longer it runs. 4.2 impact of loan ending due to death or long term care if the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then more 2 life may request medical or other specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused. the term will also end on the last borrower's death. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances, but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (again, usually when the property is sold). 4.3 sale of the property you or your attorney (if you have appointed one under a power of attorney) or personal representatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the property following the last borrower entering into long term care or dying. if the property is not sold within 12 months more 2 life may take over conduct of the sale. this would usually be if more 2 life perceived no progress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances. 4.4 bankruptcy and/or breach of material contract terms the loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the terms and conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in section 1, paragraph 9 and section 2, paragraph 4 of the terms and conditions, including being declared bankrupt. please note that early repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances. 4.5 early repayment charges. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the terms and conditions.", "298": "10 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldit is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this prior to the 15 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge. the early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date: up to the 1st anniversary the charge is 10% of the amount repaid; up to the 2nd anniversary the charge is 9% of the amount repaid; up to the 3rd anniversary the charge is 8% of the amount repaid; up to the 4th anniversary the charge is 7% of the amount repaid; up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 6% of the amount repaid; up to the 6th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid; up to the 7th anniversary the charge is 4% of the amount repaid; up to the 8th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid; up to the 9th anniversary the charge is 2% of the amount repaid; up to the 15th anniversary the charge is 1% of the amount repaid; after 15th anniversary is no charge. 4.6 exemption from early repayment charges no early repayment penalty will be charged if: you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies; after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your new property does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria; the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage to the property; you make a voluntary partial repayment; the lifetime mortgage is repaid by remaining borrower within 3 years of the death or requirement for long term care of first borrower; the cash faciity is withdrawn; or you downsize to a lower value property and are requested to make a partial repayment. 4.7 voluntary partial early repayments more 2 life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge: maximum payment of 10% of the total cash advanced within each 12 month period following completion; and minimum payment of 50; and maximum of twelve payments in a 12 month period please note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, an early repayment charge will apply (if this is within the early repayment term). where you do make partial repayments, it will reduce the level of loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up over time. if you intend to make a voluntary partial repayment, please ensure that you contact more 2 life before you make it. any proportion of the permitted voluntary partial repayments amount that is unused cannot be carried forward into the next 12-month period.", "299": "11 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldwhat are the advantages? 5.1 you will have an immediate lump sum of 50,000.00 to use as you wish, minus any retention, unless you have used the funds to clear existing debts. 5.2 you retain ownership of the property. 5.3 you can port (ie, transfer) your loan to a new property, provided that the onward property is acceptable to more 2 life. if this is more than 5 years after the initial completion date, no early repayment penalty will apply if more 2 life does not accept the new property (or you decide not to transfer the loan to it). 5.4 more 2 life does not expect repayment of this loan during your lifetime (unless/until the surviving borrower is in long term care which brings the contract to an end). you have the option to repay in full, should you so wish, subject to the early repayment calculation as set out above. 5.5 subject to you complying with the terms and conditions, more 2 life offers a no-negative equity guarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the property, even if the level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in the property. what are the disadvantages? 6.1 means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits may be affected. you should therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. 6.2 the loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in the property over time, especially where no voluntary repayments are made, and particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of the property. 6.3 further loans against the property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by more 2 life while its loan is still in existence. a further advance from more 2 life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in the property. 6.4 if you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt, the property can be repossessed (see section 1, paragraph 9 of the terms and conditions). 6.5 this is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply, should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the property is repossessed). for your peace of mind, more 2 life has set a maximum figure which can be charged of 5,341.23, which allows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging. the calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of your mortgage offer.", "300": "12 gar0392/001.0/natasha wakefieldconclusions: risk -v- reward it is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the risks of entering into this agreement. risk 7.1 if you seriously breach the terms and conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the property could be repossessed and sold to repay the loan. this may incur early repayment charges. if you are deemed to be in default, the no-negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by more 2 life as a result of the breaches. more 2 life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach. repossession would always be a matter of last resort. 7.2 if you move to a new house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on the circumstances. 7.3 further additional secured borrowing from more 2 life is not guaranteed. in addition, the drawdown facility can be removed without notice by more 2 life at any time without prior notice. 7.4 if you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty will apply if you wish to re-mortgage with another lender. 7.5 if the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump sum that you have taken, albeit unlikely. 7.6 if you do not make any voluntary interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the property in due course, particularly if the value of the property does not go up over time. this means that you would not be able to leave the property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the property has been sold. 7.7 eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely affected. 7.8 any existing charge secured against the property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion. 7.9 if your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt secured against the property, which is enforceable if you default by repossession. you should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the best course of action for you. reward: 7.10 you will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use. 7.11 there is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of the property (provided there are no material breaches of the terms and conditions). 7.12 you can potentially port this mortgage to a new property

families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to

knowledge) come into contact with any at risk individuals, arranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; re-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; adapting our face to face meetings to be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; ensuring that all staff are issued with ppe and sanitiser. we believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the erc guidelines, adhere to the law of property act requirements, adhere to the solicitors regulation authority code of conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. if you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know. it is a matter for you to decide if you

you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us. completion we will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the lender to seek your authorisation to

after completion any original documents will be returned to you after completion. we will store our file for 6 years, as required by our regulators, after which time the file will be confidentially destroyed. we can offer extended secure off site storage of your file for 30 years at a cost of 25 plus vat, if you so wish. if you wish to take up this service, please let us know before completion.

fraudsters over the last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us informing you first. and finally if you sense that something might be wrong in a communication to you from us then it probably is!", "312": "equilaw limited - terms of business about us equilaw is a

than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you. our charges our engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. together these set out the basis on which we will charge you. this will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we are unable to complete your work within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why. we will carry on and complete any additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work done, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to this document, or otherwise as agreed with you. for example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is freehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement. in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity release application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs. solicitors appointments where we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving less than two working days notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we will charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit. note that working day in this context means monday to friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. note also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application this offer does not apply to any solicitors appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the appointments (75 plus vat on each occasion) will be due for payment.", "313": "you must have your mortgage offer in writing and our legal report pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by 1.30pm on the day before

in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client and/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider. where this is necessary you will remain liable for the cost of the insurance cover required and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule. shortfall if you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together with the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake checks in accordance with the money laundering regulations 2019, and we cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made. once the funds have been approved please note that payments by debit card (we can accept up to 2,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days. please bear in mind that this may delay the completion. if you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible. billing and payment all final bills are due for payment on delivery. where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other associated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, ifa or introducer from monies received or held

establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card unless in exceptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market.

(this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax.

", "318": "2.i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4.do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9.why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me?

before signing the legal charge, offer and/or any associated lifetime mortgage paperwork. more 2 life will hold this mortgage of the property as security for the equity release loan, all interest and any associated costs and disbursements described in the legal charge and mortgage offer. you must sign the legal charge in front of a solicitor, chartered legal executive, licensed conveyancer or barrister (who should have a current practising certificate and professional indemnity insurance). for convenience, all will be referred to as solicitor for the purposes of this statement. we wendy elizabeth gardner and ernest trevor gardner of 86 overslade lane, rugby, warwickshire, cv22 6ef make this statement of truth as follows:- 1.we confirm we instructed equilaw (\"my solicitor\") to act on our behalf in this matter and that we were told by viva retirement solutions that we were free to instruct a solicitor of our choice. 2.we are fully satisfied that our solicitor has properly advised us on the nature effects and implications of our entering into the equity release plan. 3.we have read a copy of our solicitors equity release report dated and we are satisfied with the contents therein and fully understand the same. 4.we are not suffering from any physical or mental condition that prevents me/us from understanding the advice i/we have had or will receive from my/our solicitor (equilaw) or which precludes me/us from entering into the equity release contract. 5.i/we am/are aware of the implications should i/we decide to participate in the homes for ukraine scheme and that we must inform our lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if i/we fail to do so, i/we will immediately breach the terms and conditions of my/our mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with me/us, they can pursue me/us for that loss. 6.the interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan could wipe out the whole of the value of our property in due course. this means that we would not be able to leave our property or any part of it to beneficiaries under our will.", "325": "7.we are not under any undue influence or external pressure from any other party (including our family members) to proceed with this equity release contract. 8.we have been advised to seek independent expert legal and financial advice in

owner occupier has passed away or gone into permanent residential care. early repayment charges are usually repayable should we decide to repay the loan early or if we decide to sell the property and live elsewhere. the maximum charge payable in this case is 5,341.23 as set out in section 13 of the mortgage offer. accessing any further draw down will result in a higher charge being payable. 10.we have been advised to discuss the equity release contract with my family and other beneficiaries and am aware that taking out the equity release plan will reduce the value of the assets we may wish to leave to others. 11.we confirm that we have been advised that equilaw must notify the lender of any material change in circumstances that may prevent the equity release from completing (for example (but not limited to) something affecting the applicant(s) such as deterioration in health, or something affecting the property such as boundary dispute). we are aware that equilaw must be notified as

overslade lane, rugby, warwickshire, cv22 6ef in our experience, it is sometimes intended that some (or all) of the proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from viva retirement solutions and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you ", "333": "have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release

can pursue me/us for that loss. 6.the interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan could wipe out the whole of

proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from viva retirement solutions and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you ", "355": "have

fraudsters over the last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us

work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent

ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 899.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds.", "385": "disbursements disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control. we may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard equity release matter (and therefore outside of the fixed fee). as soon as we are aware of any we will notify you. marketing fees both equilaw and key retirement solutions specialise in the equity release industry. as such, we have a relationship with them which includes mutual advertising, the monitoring of completion times and a dedication to ensuring a smooth transaction. there is also a financial relationship between us whereby equilaw pays a monthly marketing contribution of 70,000.00 . despite this relationship, we will provide you

exposed; adapting our face to face meetings to be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; ensuring that all staff are issued with ppe and sanitiser. we believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the erc guidelines, adhere to the law of property act requirements, adhere to the solicitors regulation authority code of conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. if you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know. it is a matter for you to

proceed. if you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us. completion we will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the lender to seek your authorisation

have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we

to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other associated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, ifa or introducer from monies received or held on your behalf (including

establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%.

", "392": "faq 1. do i have to send in my title deeds? if your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.", "393":

will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the

release funds, we must guarantee your identity to the lenders. we can only do this by reference to government issued photographic identification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us as our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. if you do not have such documentation we will require you to complete our identity verification form. enclosed is our frequently asked questions sheet and cybercrime leaflet which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud. please note that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you notify us to the contrary. scope of work equilaw ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the equity release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser key retirement solutions, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 899.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds. 2", "398": "disbursements disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control. we may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard equity release matter (and therefore outside of the fixed fee). as soon as we are aware of any we will notify you. marketing fees both equilaw and key retirement solutions specialise in the equity release industry. as such, we have a relationship with them which includes mutual advertising, the monitoring of completion times and a dedication to ensuring a smooth transaction. there is also a financial relationship between us whereby equilaw pays a monthly marketing contribution of 70,000.00 . despite this relationship, we will provide you with independent advice and you are able to raise questions with us about any aspect of your case. signed

self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; re-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; adapting our face to face meetings to be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; ensuring that all staff are issued with ppe and sanitiser. we believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the erc guidelines, adhere to the law of property act requirements, adhere to the solicitors regulation authority code of conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. if you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know. it is a matter for you to decide if you wish to proceed. if there are additional precautions that can be taken to minimise any risk of infection to you, please let us know. it is mandatory, under law of property act 1925, for a deed to be lawfully executed that it must be executed in the presence of a physically present independent person. deeds cannot, under any circumstances, be executed via video call. once we have booked the appointment, we will send to you our legal report pack. this pack contains the documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our solicitor and without it the appointment cannot proceed. if you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us. completion we will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the lender to seek your authorisation to complete. as the action rests with more 2 lifes solicitors to carry out their pre-completion

by when. you will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work telephone number(s) and email(s). you will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances change. where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you. our charges our engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. together these set out the basis on which we will charge you. this will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we are unable to complete your work within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why. we will carry on and complete any additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work done, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to this document, or otherwise as agreed with you. for example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is freehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement. in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity release application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs. solicitors appointments where we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving less than two working days notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we will charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit. note that working day in this context means monday to friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. note also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application this offer does not apply to any solicitors appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the appointments (75 plus vat on each occasion) will be due for payment. you must have your mortgage offer in writing and our legal report pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by 1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges. indemnity insurance occasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client and/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider. where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the cost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule. shortfall if you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together with the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake checks in accordance with the money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds (information on the payer) regulations 2019, and we cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made. once the funds have been approved, please note that payments by debit card (we can accept up to 2,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days. please bear in mind that this may delay the completion. we will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan repayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is received by us. if you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible. 12", "408": "billing and payment all final bills are due for payment on delivery. where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other associated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, ifa or introducer from monies received or held on your behalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is made. where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account. where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account. we expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. all interim statute bills are due for payment on delivery. payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling either by cheque payable to equilaw limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request). shortfalls and completion funds we do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage. we are obliged under the anti money laundering regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax.

regulated by the financial conduct authority (fca) or the prudential regulation authority (pra) but we are included on the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: ls

your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next. 17", "413": "additional fees (if required) (plus vat) mining

increasingly targeted by fraudsters over the last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us informing you first. and finally if you sense that something might be wrong in a communication to you from us then it probably is! 23", "419": "reference: gor0144/001 date: 14 november 2022 mr richard

from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the

property: 30 eastern avenue east, romford, rm1 4dr in our experience, it is sometimes intended that some (or all) of the proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living

hesitate to contact karla or in her absence our compliance director david bush or our ceo claire barker (solicitor). security we take your protection against identity theft very seriously. we are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your equity release funds, we must guarantee your identity to the lenders. we can only do this by reference to government issued photographic identification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us as our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. if you do not have such documentation we will require you to complete our identity verification form. enclosed is our frequently asked questions sheet and cybercrime leaflet which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud. please note that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you notify us to the contrary. scope of work equilaw ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the equity release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser key retirement solutions, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 899.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds. disbursements disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control.", "434": "we may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard equity release matter (and therefore outside of the fixed fee). as soon as we are aware of any we will notify you. marketing fees both equilaw and key retirement solutions specialise in the equity release industry. as such, we have a relationship with them which includes mutual advertising, the monitoring of completion times and a dedication to ensuring a smooth transaction. there is also a financial relationship between us whereby equilaw pays a monthly marketing contribution of 70,000.00 . despite this relationship, we will provide you with independent advice and you are able to raise questions with us about any aspect of your case. signed plan please find enclosed a plan, obtained from the land registry, outlining what i believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return to me. if the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent. it is important that the plan is accurate. if you own any additional land, please identify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct. next steps please review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to enable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to equilaw such

video so that you know what to expect and so that you can raise any question or queries relating to the appointment. we have been successfully conducting meetings in this manner since the start of the pandemic, so you are in safe hands with equilaw. we are: closely following public health england and nhs guidance, asking our attending solicitors to self-certify weekly that they have not (to the best of their knowledge) come into contact with any at risk individuals, arranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; re-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; adapting our face to face meetings to be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; ensuring that all staff are issued with ppe and sanitiser. we believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the erc guidelines, adhere to the law of property act requirements, adhere to the solicitors regulation authority code of conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. if you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know. it is a matter for you to decide if you wish to proceed. if there are additional precautions that can be taken to minimise any risk of infection to you, please let us know. it is mandatory, under law of property act 1925, for a deed to be lawfully executed that it must be executed in the presence of a physically present independent person. deeds cannot, under any circumstances, be executed via video call. once we have booked the appointment, we will send to you our legal report pack. this pack contains the documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our solicitor and without it the appointment cannot proceed. if you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us. completion we will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the lender to seek your authorisation to complete. as the action rests with more 2 lifes solicitors to carry out their pre-completion checks we cannot give a precise time estimate. our final bill and completion statement will be sent to you following completion. we will pay your net funds directly into your bank account by bacs in three days. if you wish to obtain your funds on the same day as completion we are able to offer a premium same day service if at an additional cost of 40 +vat. please notify us if you do want to upgrade to the premium payment service and we will amend our records, but please note that funds are

where we must use same day bank transfer, for example, paying off an existing charge and this is beyond our control.

do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling either by cheque payable to equilaw limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request). shortfalls and completion funds we do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage. we are obliged under the anti money laundering regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax. (net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.) regulation and limits on our services we will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any

", "446": "faq 1. do i have to send in my title deeds? if your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.", "447":

leaflet - please read property lawyers and their clients have been increasingly targeted by fraudsters over the last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us informing you first. and finally if you sense that something might be wrong in a communication to you from us then it probably is!", "461": "form of authority fla0057/001 name of clients: mr. graham frederick flavill and mrs. elaine hilary flavill address of property: 10 rufford grove, nottingham, ng13 8rh to whom it may

property: 10 rufford grove, nottingham, ng13 8rh in our experience, it is sometimes intended that some (or all) of the proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from uk moneyman and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we recommend that you do so. i enclose a form with this letter, and i should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. once you have completed the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. please be aware that i will not be able to complete your equity release until i am in receipt of a completed and signed form. please contact us directly in

valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release

lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise

unbreakable guarantee) to standard life that the person signing the mortgage documentation is actually you. unfortunately determined fraudsters have been known to intercept mail such as utility bills or fraudulently apply for bank cards such that they can provide written evidence of identity on request. accordingly the only way that we can satisfy the warranty requirement is to rely on government issued photographic identification. if you do not have valid government issued identification it will be necessary to obtain identity verification that attains the same standard. i do understand that this is inconvenient, however i am sure that you will agree that it is a well-intentioned requirement that we must fulfil in order to complete your equity release. please find attached identification verification form for completion by both yourself and your chosen counter-signatory if you do not have valid photographic identification. there are notes for guidance attached, which should be

be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours. our responsibilities and service levels we aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost. we will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing. we will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial telephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor. we aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day and to respond to written communications within two working days. your responsibilities you will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset, so that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. you will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work telephone number(s) and email(s). you will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances change. where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you. our charges our engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. together these set out the basis on which we will charge you. this will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we are unable to complete your work within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why. we will carry on and complete any additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work done, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to this document, or otherwise as agreed with you. for example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is freehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement. in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity release application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs. solicitors appointments where we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving less than two working days notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we will charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit. note that working day in this context means monday to friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. note also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application this offer does not apply to any solicitors appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the appointments (75 plus vat on each occasion) will be due for payment. you must have your mortgage offer in writing and our legal report pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by 1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges. indemnity insurance occasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client and/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider. where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the cost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule. shortfall if you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together with the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake checks in accordance with the money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds (information on the payer) regulations 2019, and we cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made. once the funds have been approved, please note that payments by debit card (we can accept up to 2,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days. please bear in mind that this may delay the completion. we will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan repayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is received by us. if you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible. 11", "479": "billing and payment all final bills are due for payment on delivery. where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other associated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, ifa or introducer from monies received or held on your behalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is made. where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the

to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account. we expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. all interim statute bills are due for payment on delivery. payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling either by cheque payable to equilaw limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request). shortfalls and completion funds we do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage. we are obliged under the anti money laundering regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax. (net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.) regulation and limits on our services we will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey report that the equity release lender commissions. we are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the suitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance planning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought. we can perform certain limited services in relation to insurances and investments, provided they are closely linked with the legal services we are providing to you. we are not authorised or regulated by the financial conduct authority (fca) or the prudential regulation authority (pra) but we are included on the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: ls

your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next. 16", "484": "additional fees (if required) (plus vat) mining

last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us informing you first. and finally if you sense that something might be wrong in a communication to you from us then it probably is! 24", "492": "reference: fla0057/001 date: 15 november 2022 mr. graham frederick flavill and mrs. elaine hilary flavill 10 rufford grove nottingham ng13 8rh dear mr. graham frederick flavill and mrs. elaine hilary flavill property: 10 rufford grove, nottingham, ng13 8rh in our experience, it is sometimes intended that some (or all) of the proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from uk moneyman and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we recommend that you do so. i enclose a form with this letter, and i should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. once you have completed the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. please be aware that i will not be able to complete your equity release until i am in receipt of a completed and signed form. please contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand

ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment. enclosed is our frequently asked questions sheet and cybercrime leaflet which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud. please note that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you notify us to the contrary. scope of work equilaw ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the equity release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser hub financial solutions, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges if you have any secured loans, overdrafts or mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your equity release. fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 600.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds. hub financial services are paying your legal fees, so the enclosed estimated invoice is for your information only however, should any additional work be required in order to satisfy the lenders requirements you will be responsible for those fees, which we will deduct from the balance of your fees on", "501": "completion. disbursements disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our

occupation over the property which have priority to any claim which the product provider may make in the future to obtain possession and to sell it free from any rights of possession, there will be an additional fee to write to your occupiers of 55.00 plus vat per occupier. your occupier will be sent an occupier waiver deed by us once the equity release offer is issued by your lender. this document is issued by your lender and as such we are unable to amend or vary the form in any way, other than correct any spelling mistakes. each lender has slightly different requirements and please be aware that the document may state the equity release loan amount. if your lender does state the value of the loan, this is not something that they will agree to remove except in very rare and bespoke circumstances which must be referred to the lender for their specific authority. if the provision of this information to your occupier is likely to cause difficulties such that you would prefer the loan amount not to be on the occupiers waiver form, please contact me to discuss the reasons for this which i will then raise with the lenders and their solicitors directly. please do this at the earliest opportunity as completion will not be set without the completed occupiers waiver form and often lenders may need to take instruction from their funders and/or their insurers as to whether they can vary the agreed format document. this can take a number of weeks your occupier may require ila and we suggest sourcing a suitable solicitor now, so that an appointment can then be booked in as soon as we receive your mortgage offer which will also contain s requirements regarding your occupier and the relevant document for your occupier(s). unregistered land in england and wales there are two systems operating to prove ownership of property. under the land registration act 2002 it became mandatory for all land to be registered (when a specific event occurred e.g. sale or re-mortgage), however there remain a small proportion of properties which have not yet been become registered. i have searched the land registry for your property and it appears that it may be unregistered. if you believe it is registered please contact me with your title number. if your property is unregistered i require the (complete) original title deeds, evidencing your ownership and any benefits or rights that affect your property in order to progress your equity release. the deeds must be sent by us to the lenders solicitors to prove ownership and to be registered with the land registry on completion. once your property is \"registered\" the deeds become obsolete as the land registry electronic record describes the land, its owners, any rights/restrictions affecting it and there is a detailed plan of the boundaries, the government guarantees that the record is accurate for any future transactions. please send your deeds back to me as soon as possible, or if you do not have them please identify their whereabouts to me. i recommend keeping copies of the deeds and, when sending your originals that you do this via special recorded delivery. there is a land registry fee payable by you for first registration. the fee is tapered according to your propertys value, which i will confirm once i have your equity release offer which contains the current property valuation. if you are unable to find your deeds please let me know as soon as possible. if your deeds have been lost it is possible to reconstitute your deeds, but this is a time consuming (and additional cost) process which will delay your equity release whilst your property is registered. lenders will not proceed until it is proven that you own the property. application for first registration take approximately 4 months (from application) to registration. we recognise that the deeds have historic interest to you and we always request their return, but the land registry default approach is to destroy the deeds (as they are now defunct for the purposes of proving your ownership) and they are not always returned to us. when/if the deeds are returned to us we will return them to you. my fees for the additional work are on request. signed plan please find enclosed a plan, obtained from the land registry, outlining what i believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return to me. if the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent. it is important that the plan is accurate. if you own any additional land, please identify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct. next steps please review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to enable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to equilaw such as account details for existing charges, details of any occupiers or your management company (if leasehold) details. on receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer through to completion. the offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lenders solicitors (who will then send it to us). we will issue and send you a \" legal report pack\". this pack will come directly from equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer

equity release funds, we must guarantee your identity to the lenders. we can only do this by reference to government issued photographic identification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us as our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. if you do not have such documentation we will require you to complete our identity verification form. in order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your exact bank details otherwise the banking system will reject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you. in order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment. enclosed is our frequently asked questions sheet and cybercrime leaflet which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud. please note that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you notify us to the contrary. scope of work equilaw ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the equity release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser hub financial solutions, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges if you have any secured loans, overdrafts or mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your equity release. fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 600.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds. hub financial services are paying your legal fees, so the enclosed estimated invoice is for your information only however, should any additional work be required in order to satisfy the lenders requirements you will be responsible for those fees, which we will deduct from the balance of your fees on 2", "511": "completion. disbursements disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control. we may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard equity release matter (and therefore outside of the fixed fee). as soon as we are aware of any we will notify you. additional works occupiers it is a condition of the transaction that you must obtain a clear legal title to the property without any other person having rights of occupation over the property which have priority to any claim which the product provider may make in the future to obtain possession and to sell it free from any rights of possession, there will be an additional fee to write to your occupiers of 55.00 plus vat per occupier. your occupier will be sent an occupier waiver deed by us once the equity release offer is issued by your lender. this document is issued by your lender and as such we are unable to amend or vary the form in any way, other than correct any spelling mistakes. each lender has slightly different requirements and please be aware that the document may state the equity release loan amount. if your lender does state the value of the loan, this is not something that they will agree to remove except in very rare and bespoke circumstances which must be referred to the lender for their specific authority. if the provision of this information to your occupier is likely to cause difficulties such that you would prefer the loan amount not to be on the occupiers waiver form, please contact me to discuss the reasons for this which i will then raise with the lenders and their solicitors directly. please do this at the earliest opportunity as completion will not be set without the completed occupiers waiver form and often lenders may need to take instruction from their funders and/or their insurers as to whether they can vary the agreed format document. this can take a number of weeks your occupier may require ila and we suggest sourcing a suitable solicitor now, so that an appointment can then be booked in as soon as we receive your mortgage offer which will also contain s requirements regarding your occupier and the relevant document for your occupier(s). unregistered land in england and wales there are two systems operating to prove ownership of property. under the land registration act 2002 it became mandatory for all land to be registered (when a specific event occurred e.g. sale or re-mortgage), however there remain a small proportion of properties which have not yet been become registered. i have searched the land registry for your property and it appears that it may be unregistered. if you believe it is registered please contact me with your title number. if your property is unregistered i require the (complete) original title deeds, evidencing your ownership and any benefits or rights that affect your property in order to progress your equity release. the deeds must be sent by us to the lenders solicitors to prove ownership and to be registered with the land registry on completion. once your property is \"registered\" the deeds become obsolete as the land registry electronic record describes the land, its owners, any rights/restrictions affecting it and there is a detailed plan of the boundaries, the government guarantees that the record is accurate for any future transactions. please send your deeds back to me as soon as possible, or if you do not have them please identify their whereabouts to me. i recommend keeping copies of the deeds and, when sending your originals that you do this via special recorded delivery. there is a land registry fee payable by you for first registration. the fee is tapered according to your propertys value, which i will confirm once i have your equity release offer which contains the current property valuation. if you are unable to find your deeds please let me know as soon as possible. if your deeds have been lost it is possible to reconstitute your deeds, but this is a time consuming (and additional cost) process which will delay your equity release whilst your property is registered. lenders will not proceed until it is proven that you own the property. application for first registration take approximately 4 months (from application) to registration. we recognise that the deeds have historic interest to you and we always request their return, but the land registry default approach is to destroy the deeds (as they are now defunct for the purposes of proving your ownership) and they are not always returned to us. when/if the deeds are returned to us we will return them to you. my fees for the additional work are on request. signed plan please find enclosed a plan, obtained from the land registry, outlining what i believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return to me. if the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent. it is important that the plan is accurate. if you own any additional land, please identify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct. next steps please review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to enable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to equilaw such as account details for existing charges, details of any occupiers or your management company (if leasehold) details. on receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer through to completion. the offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lenders solicitors (who will then send it to us). we will issue and

you will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances change. where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you. our charges our engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. together these set out the basis on which we will charge you. this will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we are unable to complete your work within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why. we will carry on and complete any additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work done, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to this document, or otherwise as agreed with you. for example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is freehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement. in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity release application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs. solicitors appointments where we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving less than two working days notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we will charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit. note that working day in this context means monday to friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. note also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application this offer does not apply to any solicitors appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the appointments (75 plus vat on each occasion) will be due for payment. you must have your mortgage offer in writing and our legal report pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by 1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges. indemnity insurance occasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client and/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider. where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the cost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule. shortfall if you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together with the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake checks in accordance with the money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds (information on the payer) regulations 2019, and we cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made. once the funds have been approved, please note that payments by debit card (we can accept up to 2,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days. please bear in mind that this may delay the completion. we will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan repayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is received by us. if you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible. 9", "518": "billing and payment all final bills are due for payment on delivery. where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other associated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, ifa or introducer from monies received or held on your behalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is made. where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account. where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account. we expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. all interim statute bills are due for payment on delivery. payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling either by cheque payable to equilaw limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request). shortfalls and completion funds we do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage. we are obliged under the anti money laundering regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax. (net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.) regulation and limits on our services we will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey report that the equity release lender commissions. we are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the suitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance planning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought. we can perform certain limited services in relation to insurances and investments, provided they are closely linked with the legal services we are providing to you. we are not authorised or regulated by the financial conduct authority (fca) or the prudential regulation authority (pra) but we are included on the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: ls 525526) so that we can carry on insurance mediation activity, which is broadly advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. this part of our business, including arrangements for redress if something goes wrong, is authorised and regulated by the solicitors regulation authority. the register of exempt professional firms can be accessed via the financial conduct authority website at: https://register.fca.org.uk/shpo_homepage the law society of england and wales is a designated professional body for the purposes of the financial services and markets act 2000 but the

your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next. 14", "523": "additional fees (if required) (plus vat) mining

lawyers and their clients have been increasingly targeted by fraudsters over the last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us informing you first. and finally if you sense that something might be wrong in a communication to you from us then it probably is! 20",

few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us informing you first. and finally if you

either or both of you. our charges our engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. together these set out the basis on which we will charge you. this will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we are unable to complete your work within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why. we will carry on and complete any additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work done, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to this document, or otherwise as agreed with you. for example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is freehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement. in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity release application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs. solicitors appointments where we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving less than two working days notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we will charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit. note that working day in this context means monday to friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. note also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application this offer does not apply to any solicitors appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the appointments (75 plus vat on each occasion) will be due for payment. you must have your mortgage offer in writing and our legal report pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by 1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges. indemnity insurance occasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client and/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider. where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the cost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule. shortfall if you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together with the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake checks in accordance with the money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds (information on the payer) regulations 2019, and we cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made. once the funds have been approved, please note that payments by debit card (we can accept up to 2,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days. please bear in mind that this may delay the completion. we will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan repayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity

due for payment on delivery. where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other associated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or

funds we do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage. we are obliged under the anti money laundering regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax.

they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.", "543":

mortgage is a special type of loan designed to run for the rest of your life or until you have to leave the property permanently for the purposes of long term care. it will provide you with a cash facility and in some instances you may take additional advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet. you do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make monthly payments as described in section 10. interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or rolled-up) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property when you die or permanently leave the property for long term care. if you repay the amount owed before this time, you may need to pay an early repayment charge. 1. your lifetime mortgage agreement 1.1 your lifetime mortgage agreement with us is made up of these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions, your offer pack, mortgage deed and tariff of charges. where in these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents. 1.2 if there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority: a) your offer pack; b) tariff of charges; c) these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions; and d) mortgage deed. 2. your cash facility 2.1 we have agreed to make available to you a cash facility. the amount of your cash facility is shown in your initial advance offer. 3. your initial advance 3.1 you must take an initial advance from your cash facility for an amount agreed between us and you. the amount of the initial advance is shown in your initial advance offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage completes.11 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "582": "5 terms and conditions 4. additional advances your lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your cash facility without further approval. your most recent offer will confirm how much may be available to you. if you wish to take an additional advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the interest rate and other terms that will apply to this additional advance. if you wish to proceed we will send to you an additional advance offer. 4.1 if you have an unused cash facility, you can request an additional advance at any time while you are still living in the property. the amount of any additional advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum additional advance amount shown in your initial advance offer. additional advances are only available up to the value of the unused cash facility. 4.2 if the additional advance is available to you, we will send to you an additional advance offer which shows the terms for the additional advance including the amount of the additional advance, the interest rate and a description of any early repayment charge that will apply. the interest rate may be different to the rate applicable to the initial advance and any other additional advance(s). 4.3 if you accept the additional advance offer and we receive your acceptance before the offer expires, we will pay the amount of the additional advance to your chosen bank account when your additional advance completes. your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 if you request an additional advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the additional advance to your bank account. 4.5 additional advances will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property and are subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. 5. your unused cash facility 5.1 the amount of money left in the cash facility for you to take any additional advances from is called the unused cash facility. each time you take an advance or any fees or costs are added to the amount owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your unused cash facility will decrease. if the arrangement fee for your initial advance is added to the amount owed, that will not affect the unused cash facility. 5.2 if you take additional advances, the amount of money left in your unused cash facility will be shown in your most recent additional advance offer.4 5 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "583": "6terms and conditions 6. circumstances when you may be unable to take additional advances there are some circumstances when we may not give you an additional advance. this may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. this section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an additional advance even though you have not used all of your cash facility. 6.1 in some circumstances you will be unable to take additional advances. if, when you request an additional advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your unused cash facility will not be available to you: a) if the total of all the advances you have received exceeds the maximum loan amount based on your age and property value at the time the request for an additional advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time the request for an additional advance is made; d) if the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either party has died; e) if a default event occurs (default events are set out in section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the fca, the fca (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the additional advance;or g) if a charge has been registered on the property (see section 29.2 for more details of this restriction). 6.2 if the event in section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow additional advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. you will be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our costs, even if we do not agree to provide the additional advance, or the additional advance does not complete. 6.3 if you believe that our assessment of the value of the property in section 6.1(a) or section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified valuer to value the property. you will need to pay a valuation fee before the valuation of the property. in the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the additional advance then we will refund the valuation fee to you.6 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "584": "7 terms and conditions 7. increasing your cash facility when you have used up your cash facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing. you can apply to increase your cash facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay fees as referred to in this section. you will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser. 7.1 when you have used all of your cash facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your cash facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. any increase to your cash facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. if we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased cash facility in an additional advance offer. 7.2 if we agree to increase your cash facility, you will be able to take an additional advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new unused cash facility. after you have taken the additional advance up to the full amount of your unused cash facility, the unused cash facility will be zero. 7.3 if you decide to request an increase to your cash facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated fees. your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.4 if we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.5 we may obtain a new valuation of the property from an independent, qualified valuer. if we do, you will need to pay a non- refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property. 7.6 if you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your cash facility. also, to be eligible for an increase in your cash facility, you and the property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your cash facility.7 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "585": "8terms and conditions 8. the property as security your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property. additional advances and other amounts added to the amount owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property. 8.1 the amount owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the amount owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime. 8.2 we require a first legal charge over the property. when you have signed and accepted your offer and the mortgage deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the property at the land registry. 8.3 if the property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. 8.4 if the property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the amount owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. if we sell the property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser. 8.5 you must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else. 9. interest this section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. interest is charged daily and rolled up monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your offer. the interest rate for the initial advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make monthly payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these monthly payments, please refer to section 10.7). 9.1 the interest rate on your initial advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your initial advance offer. 9.2 the interest rate on each additional advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the additional advance. the interest rate on the additional advance could be higher or lower than the interest rate on your initial advance. we provide an additional advance offer confirming the interest rate each time we agree to provide you with an additional advance. 98 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "586": "9 terms and conditions 9.3 the interest rate shown in an offer is only available if the advance completes before that offer expires. the date an offer expires is shown in that offer. if an offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new offer, the interest rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new offer and is shown in your new offer. 9.4 the interest rate on any fees or costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the fees or costs are added. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such fees and costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 interest is charged daily at the interest rate on each amount which forms part of the amount owed, from the date that amount is added to the amount owed, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 the interest that is charged daily forms part of the amount owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged: a) for advances, from the date the relevant advance completes; or b) for any other amount (including fees and costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the amount owed. each month, the interest that is charged daily is rolled-up, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest rolls-up. 9.7 interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the amount owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before. 9.8 a lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the amount owed. call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "587": "10terms and conditions 10. monthly payments as part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make monthly payments against the amount of interest charged. the amount of your ongoing monthly payment can be set between 25 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your initial advance and any additional advances. once your monthly payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a payment holiday or stop making your monthly payments altogether. if you choose to stop making monthly payments, or fail to make the monthly payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest roll- up for the remainder of your loan. once you have stopped making monthly payments they cannot be restarted. this section explains more about your options. 10.1 at the outset of your initial advance and each additional advance you can select to make monthly payments. 10.2 for the initial advance you can choose to pay between a minimum of 25.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest. 10.3 for additional advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making monthly payments on your initial advance. 10.4 the total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the advance by the interest rate and dividing by 12. 10.5 your monthly payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month. 10.6 once you have completed you cannot change the amount of your monthly payments. 10.7 you can stop making monthly payments at any time subject to giving us 1 months written notice. once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10.8 you may request one payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following completion of the initial advance, providing you give us 1 months written notice. interest not paid during a payment holiday will be added to the amount owed and interest will roll up on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage. 10.9 if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment for any month within 3 working days of the next monthly payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting monthly payments and you will not be able to re-start them. this means the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10 call 01737 233297 or visit

you make a partial repayment on your lifetime mortgage we may reduce the amount of your monthly payment to reflect the change in the amount owed and ensure you are not paying more than the interest due. 10.12 all monthly payments must be made in sterling. if any monthly payment falls due on a day which is not a business day, we will collect on the next business day. 11. fees that you may need to pay throughout this booklet we refer to fees that you may need to pay to us. this section tells you more about fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the fees will be. 11.1 the fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these fees are payable are described in your initial advance offer. 11.2 the fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an additional advance and when these fees are payable are described in each additional advance offer. 11.3 other fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the tariff of charges. from time to time, we may review the fees that we charge and we may add new fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect : 11.3.1 a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services; or 11.3.2 any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business. 11.4 if we change the fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new tariff of charges. 12. costs that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. you may also need to pay costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical costs that may arise. 12.1 you must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "589": "12terms and conditions 12.2 you must pay the reasonable costs that we incur during your lifetime mortgage and we will tell you at least 28 days before you need to pay us. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 12.3 where we add fees or costs to the amount owed, they will be treated in the same way as advances for the purposes of charging interest and early repayment charges, determining how much of your unused cash facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the amount owed. 13. the term of your lifetime mortgage 13.1 your offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. the term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage agreement continues to apply until the amount owed is repaid in full. 14. special conditions in some instances we may need to apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage. these special conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the property as recommended by the valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. 14.1 we may apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these special conditions are set out in your offer. special conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve the conflict. 14.2 we may ask you to satisfy special conditions before your lifetime mortgage completes. where special conditions require you to take some action in relation to the property after your lifetime mortgage completes you will have 6 months from the date of completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing. 14.3 we may require you to provide documents to confirm that a special condition in relation to the property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the property. you may need to pay a non- refundable fee for this re-inspection.1413 call 01737 233297 or

keep the property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. sometimes you will not be able to insure the property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. an example of that would be if the property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. in that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it. 25.2 the insurance policy must: a) be with a reputable insurer; b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the property, which is designed to cover the amount (including value added tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the property, clear the site of the property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and pay for alternative accommodation; c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the house rebuilding cost index or such other index as we reasonably require; d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require; e) if you are purchasing the property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever is the earliest; and f) if you are re-mortgaging the property, be on risk at least two business days before completion of your lifetime mortgage. 25.3 our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. if we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). in the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 you must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy. 25.5 you must pay the insurance premiums on time. you must show us

possible and assist the insurance company to resolve the claim. 26.4 we may also make a claim on your insurance and negotiate and settle any claims on your behalf. 26.5 the claims money must be used to make good any loss or damage it has been paid for, or if we agree with you, it will be used to reduce or repay the amount owed. if there has been significant loss or damage to the property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us. 27. maintaining the property you will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the property. we will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the property to a standard that exceeds the condition at the time we valued the property,

your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the property. other lenders may not be willing to lend to you because we have a first charge on the property and the amount owed will increase due to the roll-up of interest.2928 call 01737 233297 or visit

with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event. you might also need to repay early if there is a default event, which is described in section 43 of this booklet. 35.1 you can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. the amount owed, including all of the interest, fees and costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the property, although the amount owed can be repaid from other funds. 35.2 a repayment event will occur when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. the amount owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the repayment event. you must tell us as soon as possible in writing if a repayment event occurs. 35.3 in the event of your

even if these are less than the amount owed. there is no additional charge for this guarantee. this section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply. 36.1 you must seek our written permission before you sell the property. if we reasonably believe that the anticipated sale proceeds might be less than the amount owed, including any early repayment charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified valuer to assess the property value. you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation is carried out. 36.2 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, we will accept the sale proceeds as full repayment of the amount owed. if you have breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, then the terms of section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee. 36.3 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the property. if we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the sale proceeds are not enough to cover the amount owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the sale proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the amount owed. 36.4 in the case of any proposed sale of the property, if we reasonably believe that the sale proceeds will be less than the amount owed, we may spend money on the property in order to make it more marketable. this may include paying for further valuations of the property. any amount we spend under this section will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. we will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). we will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the property is sold. if we are unable to sell the property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 if you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the property has been reduced, and/or the amount owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the sale proceeds being less than the amount owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. in this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the sale proceeds and the amount owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage agreement.36 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "604": "27 terms and conditions 36.6 if an independent valuation carried out following a repayment event

certain limits specified in the offer pack and as set out in section 38.7 below, but you may have to pay an early repayment charge on any partial repayment that you make in excess of these limits. making a partial repayment will not increase your unused cash facility, but may reduce your cash facility. if you are making monthly payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge and section 38.7 will not apply. you should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 38.1 if there is any repayment of part of the amount owed, we may reduce your cash facility and you may have to pay an early repayment charge. 38.2 each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your initial advance offer unless the conditions set out in section 38.7 are met in respect of that partial repayment. section 38.7 does not apply if you are making monthly payments and so any partial repayment you choose to make whilst making monthly payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an early repayment charge. 38.3 we will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. this does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the property. 38.4 if there is any partial repayment it will reduce the amount owed immediately. if you have more than one advance, or costs and fees have been added to the amount owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your advances, and the costs and fees that have been added (excluding any early repayment charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 if you are making monthly payments, as detailed within section 10, then section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge if those repayments are within the early repayment period. 38.6 partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period

total of 6 partial repayments are made in the relevant 12 month period; c) each partial repayment is 500 or more; and d) the partial repayment does not result in reducing the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. if you have more than one advance, the amount of the partial repayment will be allocated between the advances in proportion to the amount you owe on each advance. 38.7 partial repayments will be allocated as follows: a) if the partial repayment meets the conditions in section 38.6, no early repayment charge applies. any partial repayment will be allocated between advances and any fees and costs in proportion to the advance and fees and costs when compared to the amount owed. the partial repayment will be allocated between capital and interest. this split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest). b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in section 38.6, an early repayment charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the early repayment period. this charge could be zero . if this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. if the early repayment charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above. 39. early repayment charges if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an early repayment charge. this is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. the early repayment charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we offer a two different early repayment charge options; variable and fixed. the type of early repayment charge must be chosen at outset. once the initial advance has completed, the type of early repayment charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the initial advance and all subsequent advances. please refer to your offer letter to understand which option applies to your lifetime mortgage. further details on the early repayment charge, including cash examples are included in your initial advance offer and each additional advance offer. the guide to our early repayment charge contains helpful information about early repayment charges.39 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "607": "30terms and conditions 39.1 the early repayment charge is charged against each advance you receive from your cash facility to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a repayment event. fees and costs may be applied to the advance and these will increase the amount owed. please refer to the definitions section for details on when fees and costs may be applied. the early repayment charge will be applied to the total amount owed. 39.2 a maximum early repayment charge will apply to your initial advance and will be shown in your initial advance offer a maximum early repayment charge will also apply to each additional advance and will be shown in each additional advance offer 39.3 if you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your early repayment charge payable at that time. variable early repayment charge 39.4 the variable early repayment charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining early repayment period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements). the way we calculate the variable early repayment charge is set out in your offer. we have set out a worked example of how the variable early repayment charge is calculated in the early repayment charge guide. fixed early repayment charge 39.5 the fixed early repayment charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid. the amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest. the early repayment charge percentage will reduce throughout the early repayment period. after the end of the early repayment period, an early repayment charge will not be payable. the fixed early repayment charge structure and a worked example is set out in your offer and our early repayment charge guide 40. benchmark interest rates (applicable to the variable early repayment charge only) the variable early repayment charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements. for this, we use the uk ftse 15 year gilt yield index. this index is published daily in the financial times (under gilts uk ftse actuaries indices, yield indices, 15 yrs). for each advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. your offer will show the benchmark interest rate and the target benchmark interest rate for the advance. 40.1 on any business day, we use the benchmark interest rate published on the previous business day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the business day before that.40 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "608": "31 terms and conditions 40.2 a target benchmark interest rate applies to your initial advance and is shown in your initial advance offer. a target benchmark interest rate also applies to each additional advance and is shown in each additional advance offer. 40.3 you must ask us for a repayment statement before you make a repayment. a repayment needs to be made during the period a repayment statement remains valid for the figures shown in the statement to apply. if a repayment is not made during the period a repayment statement remains valid, you must obtain another repayment statement from us. 40.4 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is less than the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is payable for that advance. an illustration of this early repayment charge is contained in your offer. 40.5 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is the same as, or more than, the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is not payable for that advance. 40.6 your offer provides a table of early repayment charge cash examples for particular movements in the benchmark interest rate and you should refer to the worked example mentioned in section 39.4 above for an illustration of how the movements in the benchmark interest rate affects the early repayment charge. 41. circumstances when early repayment charges do not apply early repayment charges only apply if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early, but even if it is repaid early you may not have to pay an early repayment charge. this section describes the circumstances when you do not have to pay an early repayment charge. 41.1 an early repayment charge is not payable if: a) repayment of your lifetime mortgage happens after you or each of you, if you are borrowing jointly, die or permanently leave the property for the purposes of long term care and the evidence you have provided is reasonably satisfactory to us; or

long term care and the evidence you have provided is reasonably satisfactory to us: or c) for each advance, repayment of that advance happens after the early repayment period applicable to that advance; or d) an early repayment is within a permitted partial repayment as set out in section 38.6; or e) in the case of a variable early repayment charge, section 40.5 applies and the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is the same as, or more than, the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance: or41 call 01737 233297 or visit

maintaining the property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage agreement. this section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement. if there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home. 42.1 if you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage agreement then this is a breach. 42.2 if a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. we will allow you a reasonable time to do so. we will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender. 42.3 if you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. for example, this may require us to enter the property and carry out repairs. 42.4 if we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any costs that we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. 42.5 where we have to take action or incur costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement (whether or not we add costs to the amount owed because you have not paid them). 42.6 if you breach your

time; b) your lifetime mortgage; c) us in relation to your lifetime mortgage; or d) the value of the property. 43.3 the following are examples of breaches that will be considered serious breaches of

security but these do not include appointing a receiver. we are entitled to exercise our rights and remedies ourselves. please see section 55.9. 45.1 if a default event occurs, or if the property or

laws of england and wales. 52.2 if the property is in scotland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of scotland. 52.3 if the property is in northern ireland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of northern ireland. 52.4 the terms of your lifetime mortgage agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the united kingdom in which the property is located. this means if the property is located in england or wales, the competent court will be the courts of england and wales. if the property is located in scotland, the competent court will be the scottish courts. if the property is located in northern ireland, the competent court will be the courts in northern ireland. 52.5 if any of the terms and

reflect an improvement of any service or facility we supply in connection with your mortgage; c) to introduce a new service; d) to replace an existing service with a new one (but only where this would

practice we follow (where the change would not be to your disadvantage). 53.3 we will write to you at least 28 days before we have to make any changes, unless the change in the law or regulation requires us to make the change more quickly. 54. giving notice 54.1 we will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters we send will be sent to you at the property, unless you have given us another address to use. 54.2 you must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your

for properties in scotland due to the different legal practices, if the property is in scotland then this section will apply to you. 55.1 in section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common. if the property is in scotland, this means that the property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. in section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. in scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy. 55.2 where we refer to a legal charge, if the property is in scotland, this means a standard security under the conveyancing and feudal reform (scotland) act 1970 (the 1970 act). if we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security. 55.3 in section 8, section 22, section 23 and section 25, there are references to the property being leasehold. this is rare for a house in scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. in the unlikely event that they do, leasehold means held on a long lease and freehold means owned. forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in scotland as irritancy. in section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the property under a lease.54 55 call 01737 233297

adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. this has the effect that our rights in relation to the property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have. 55.6

1970 act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in section 45.5, section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver. 55.11 we have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 act. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. if we take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. if we have to sell the property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply

lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make monthly payments as described in section 10. interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or rolled-up) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property when you die or permanently leave the property for long term care. if you repay the amount owed before this time, you may need to pay an early repayment charge. 1. your lifetime mortgage agreement 1.1 your lifetime mortgage agreement with us is made up of these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions, your offer pack, mortgage deed and tariff of charges. where in these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents. 1.2 if there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority: a) your offer pack; b) tariff of charges; c) these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions; and d) mortgage deed. 2. your cash facility 2.1 we have agreed to make available to you a cash facility. the amount of your cash facility is shown in your initial advance offer. 3. your initial advance 3.1 you must take an initial advance from your cash facility for an amount agreed between us and you. the amount of the initial advance is shown in your initial advance offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage completes.11 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "656": "5 terms and conditions 4. additional advances your lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your cash facility without further approval. your most recent offer will confirm how much may be available to you. if you wish to take an additional advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the interest rate and other terms that will apply to this additional advance. if you wish to proceed we will send to you an additional advance offer. 4.1 if you have an unused cash facility, you can request an additional advance at any time while you are still living in the property. the amount of any additional advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum additional advance amount shown in your initial advance offer. additional advances are only available up to the value of the unused cash facility. 4.2 if the additional advance is available to you, we will send to you an additional advance offer which shows the terms for the additional advance including the amount of the additional advance, the interest rate and a description of any early repayment charge that will apply. the interest rate may be different to the rate applicable to the initial advance and any other additional advance(s). 4.3 if you accept the additional advance offer and we receive your acceptance before the offer expires, we will pay the amount of the additional advance to your chosen bank account when your additional advance completes. your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 if you request an additional advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the additional advance to your bank account. 4.5 additional advances will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property and are subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. 5. your unused cash facility 5.1 the amount of money left in the cash facility for you to take any additional advances from is called the unused cash facility. each time you take an advance or any fees or costs are added to the amount owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your unused cash facility will decrease. if the arrangement fee for your initial advance is added to the amount owed, that will not affect the unused cash facility. 5.2 if you take additional advances, the amount of money left in your unused cash facility will be shown in your most recent additional advance offer.4 5 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "657": "6terms and conditions 6. circumstances when you may be unable to take additional advances there are some circumstances when we may not give you an additional advance. this may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. this section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an additional advance even though you have not used all of your cash facility. 6.1 in some circumstances you will be unable to take additional advances. if, when you request an additional advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your unused cash facility will not be available to you: a) if the total of all the advances you have received exceeds the maximum loan amount based on your age and property value at the time the request for an additional advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time the request for an additional advance is made; d) if the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either party has died; e) if a default event occurs (default events are set out in section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the fca, the fca (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the additional advance;or g) if a charge has been registered on the property (see section 29.2 for more details of this restriction). 6.2 if the event in section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow additional advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. you will be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our costs, even if we do not agree to provide the additional advance, or the additional advance does not complete. 6.3 if you believe that our assessment of the value of the property in section 6.1(a) or section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified valuer to value the property. you will need to pay a valuation fee before the valuation of the property. in the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the additional advance then we will refund the valuation fee to you.6 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "658": "7 terms and conditions 7. increasing your cash facility when you have used up your cash facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing. you can apply to increase your cash facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay fees as referred to in this section. you will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser. 7.1 when you have used all of your cash facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your cash facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. any increase to your cash facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. if we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased cash facility in an additional advance offer. 7.2 if we agree to increase your cash facility, you will be able to take an additional advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new unused cash facility. after you have taken the additional advance up to the full amount of your unused cash facility, the unused cash facility will be zero. 7.3 if you decide to request an increase to your cash facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated fees. your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.4 if we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.5 we may obtain a new valuation of the property from an independent, qualified valuer. if we do, you will need to pay a non- refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property. 7.6 if you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your cash facility. also, to be eligible for an increase in your cash facility, you and the property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your cash facility.7 call

of the property. additional advances and other amounts added to the amount owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property. 8.1 the amount owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the amount owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime. 8.2 we require a first legal charge over the property. when you have signed and accepted your offer and the mortgage deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the property at the land registry. 8.3 if the property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. 8.4 if the property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the amount owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. if we sell the property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser. 8.5 you must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else. 9. interest this section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. interest is charged daily and rolled up monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your offer. the interest rate for the initial advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make monthly payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these monthly payments, please refer to section 10.7). 9.1 the interest rate on your initial advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your initial advance offer. 9.2 the interest rate on each additional advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the additional advance. the interest rate on the additional advance could be higher or lower than the interest rate on your initial advance. we provide an additional advance offer confirming the interest rate each time we agree to provide you with an additional advance. 98 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "660": "9 terms and conditions 9.3 the interest rate shown in an offer is only available if the advance completes before that offer expires. the date an offer expires is shown in that offer. if an offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new offer, the interest rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new offer and is shown in your new offer. 9.4 the interest rate on any fees or costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the fees or costs are added. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such fees and costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 interest is charged daily at the interest rate on each amount which forms part of the amount owed, from the date that amount is added to the amount owed, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 the interest that is charged daily forms part of the amount owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged: a) for advances, from the date the relevant advance completes; or b) for any other amount (including fees and costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the amount owed. each month, the interest that is charged daily is rolled-up, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest rolls-up. 9.7 interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the amount owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before. 9.8 a lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the amount owed. call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk",

payment can be set between 25 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your initial advance and any additional advances. once your monthly payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a payment holiday or stop making your monthly payments altogether. if you choose to stop making monthly payments, or fail to make the monthly payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest roll- up for the remainder of your loan. once you have stopped making monthly payments they cannot be restarted. this section explains more about your options. 10.1 at the outset of your initial advance and each additional advance you can select to make monthly payments. 10.2 for the initial advance you can choose to pay between a minimum of 25.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest. 10.3 for additional advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making monthly payments on your initial advance. 10.4 the total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the advance by the interest rate and dividing by 12. 10.5 your monthly payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month. 10.6 once you have completed you cannot change the amount of your monthly payments. 10.7 you can stop making monthly payments at any time subject to giving us 1 months written notice. once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10.8 you may request one payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following completion of the initial advance, providing you give us 1 months written notice. interest not paid during a payment holiday will be added to the amount owed and interest will roll up on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage. 10.9 if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment for any month within 3 working days of the next monthly payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting monthly payments and you will not be able to re-start them. this means the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10 call 01737 233297 or visit

you make a partial repayment on your lifetime mortgage we may reduce the amount of your monthly payment to reflect the change in the amount owed and ensure you are not paying more than the interest due. 10.12 all monthly payments must be made in sterling. if any monthly payment falls due on a day which is not a business day, we will collect on the next business day. 11. fees that you may need to pay throughout this booklet we refer to fees that you may need to pay to us. this section tells you more about fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the fees will be. 11.1 the fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these fees are payable are described in your initial advance offer. 11.2 the fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an additional advance and when these fees are payable are described in each additional advance offer. 11.3 other fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the tariff of charges. from time to time, we may review the fees that we charge and we may add new fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect : 11.3.1 a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services; or 11.3.2 any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business. 11.4 if we change the fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new tariff of charges. 12. costs that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. you may also need to pay costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical costs that may arise. 12.1 you must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "663":

costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 12.3 where we add fees or costs to the amount owed, they will be treated in the same way as advances for the purposes of charging interest and early repayment charges, determining how much of your unused cash facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the amount owed. 13. the term of your lifetime mortgage 13.1 your offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. the term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage agreement continues to apply until the amount owed is repaid in full. 14. special conditions in some instances we may need to apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage. these special conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the property as recommended by the valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. 14.1 we may apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these special conditions are set out in your offer. special conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve the conflict. 14.2 we may ask you to satisfy special conditions before your lifetime mortgage completes. where special conditions require you to take some action in relation to the property after your lifetime mortgage completes you will have 6 months from the date of completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing. 14.3 we may require you to provide documents to confirm that a special condition in relation to the property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the property. you may need to pay a non- refundable fee for this re-inspection.1413 call 01737 233297 or

property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and pay for alternative accommodation; c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the house rebuilding cost index or such other index as we reasonably require; d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require; e) if you are purchasing the property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever is the earliest; and f) if you are re-mortgaging the property, be on risk at least two business days before completion of your lifetime mortgage. 25.3 our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. if we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). in the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 you must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy. 25.5 you must pay the insurance premiums on time. you must show us

reserve the right, but are not obliged, to insure the property. if we insure the property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. you will need to pay the costs that we incur in insuring the property. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. 25.8 you can ask us for details of any insurance we have put in place in respect of the property. 26. insurance claims 26.1 you must tell us as soon as possible if there is any significant loss or damage to the property. 26.2 you must take reasonable steps to make sure that nothing happens which may harm your or our ability to make a claim under the insurance. 26.3 if it is necessary to make a claim on your insurance you must tell the insurance company as soon as possible and assist the insurance company to resolve the claim. 26.4 we may also make a claim on your insurance and negotiate and settle any claims on your behalf. 26.5 the claims money must be used to make good any loss or damage it has been paid for, or if we agree with you, it will be used to reduce or repay the amount owed. if there has been significant loss or damage to the property, we may

if the repairs are not made, we may arrange for the repairs to be carried out on your behalf and you will need to pay any costs that we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. if, in our reasonable opinion, we decide that the property is not being maintained in accordance with this section 27 and you fail to carry out the repairs required under this section 27.5, this will be a serious breach of your lifetime mortgage. 28. making changes to the property you must tell us if you wish to alter the property. we will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the property, but we have put in place safeguards. these safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard. 28.1 you must not alter the property structurally, extend or convert the property or change the use of the property unless you have our written permission to do so. you will be responsible for paying for the cost of preparing any plans or reports required by us, and all the expenses and

your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the property. other lenders may not be willing to lend to you because we have a first charge on the property and the amount owed will increase due to the roll-up of interest.2928 call 01737 233297 or visit

the legal responsibilities as if we had possessed the property. what if your circumstances change? this part covers what you need to know if your circumstances change. if a change in your circumstances makes it necessary to alter your lifetime mortgage then you will need to pay any fees and costs due to us, plus any legal fees, expenses and taxes payable to others. you must tell us

lifetime mortgage will need to be transferred too. the transfer is subject to the new occupant being eligible for your lifetime mortgage and being acceptable to us. in some instances we may reduce

permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. this section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. we recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event. you might also need to repay early if there is a default event, which is described in section 43 of this booklet. 35.1 you can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. the amount owed, including all of the interest, fees and costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the property, although the amount owed can be repaid from other funds. 35.2 a repayment event will occur when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. the amount owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the repayment event. you must tell us as soon as possible in writing if a repayment event occurs. 35.3 in the event of your death, your personal representative must notify us of this in writing and provide us with a death certificate and any other documentation that we reasonably require. 35.4 if you permanently leave the property for the purposes of long term care, you must provide us with written confirmation from a suitably qualified doctor or other medical or care professional who is acceptable to us. this confirmation must be in the form we reasonably require, and must confirm that you require long term care and provide details of the long term care arrangements. you should provide us with this confirmation before you leave the property so that we can confirm whether this would be an early repayment and whether an early repayment charge may be payable. 35.5 if the information provided in the written confirmation is not reasonably satisfactory to us, or is not provided before your lifetime mortgage is repaid, then payment of the amount owed will be regarded as early repayment and an early repayment charge will be payable if the payment is within the early repayment period. 35.6 following a repayment event, you (or your personal representatives in the event of your death) must, without delay, take all reasonable steps to market the property for sale and to negotiate the best possible price reasonably obtainable for the property. you must obtain our written consent to the sale.35

when the property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the sale proceeds, even if these are less than the amount owed. there is no additional charge for this guarantee. this section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply. 36.1 you must seek our written permission before you sell the property. if we reasonably believe that the anticipated sale proceeds might be less than the amount owed, including any early repayment charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified valuer to assess the property value. you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation is carried out. 36.2 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, we will accept the sale proceeds as full repayment of the amount owed. if you have breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, then the terms of section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee. 36.3 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the property. if we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the sale proceeds are not enough to cover the amount owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the sale proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the amount owed. 36.4 in the case of any proposed sale of the property, if we reasonably believe that the sale proceeds will be less than the amount owed, we may spend money on the property in order to make it more marketable. this may include paying for further valuations of the property. any amount we spend under this section will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. we will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). we will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the property is sold. if we are unable to sell the property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 if you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the property has been reduced, and/or the amount owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the sale proceeds being less than the amount owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. in this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the sale proceeds and the amount owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage agreement.36 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "678": "27 terms and conditions 36.6 if an independent valuation carried out following a repayment event

repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any early repayment charge payable at that time. you should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 37.1 if you repay all or part of the amount owed before a repayment event as explained in section 35 (which explains when a repayment event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. you can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but

making a partial repayment will not increase your unused cash facility, but may reduce your cash facility. if you are making monthly payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments

from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 38.1 if there is any repayment of part of the amount owed, we may reduce your cash facility and you may have to pay an early repayment charge. 38.2 each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your initial advance offer unless the conditions set out in section 38.7 are met in respect of that partial repayment. section 38.7 does not apply if you are making monthly payments and so any partial repayment you choose to make whilst making monthly payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an early repayment charge. 38.3 we will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. this does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the property. 38.4 if there is any partial repayment it will reduce the amount owed immediately. if you have more than one advance, or costs and fees have been added to the amount owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your advances, and the costs and fees that have been added (excluding any early repayment charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 if you are making monthly payments, as detailed within section 10, then section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to

that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. if you have more than one advance, the amount of the partial repayment will be allocated between the advances in proportion to the amount you owe on each advance. 38.7 partial repayments will be allocated as follows: a) if the partial repayment meets the conditions in section 38.6, no early repayment charge applies. any partial repayment will be allocated between advances and any fees and costs in proportion to the advance and fees and costs when compared to the amount owed. the partial repayment will be allocated between capital and interest. this split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest). b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in section 38.6, an early repayment charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the early repayment period. this charge could be zero . if this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. if the early repayment charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.

variable early repayment charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining early repayment period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements). the way we calculate the variable early repayment charge is set out in your offer. we have set out a worked example of how the variable early repayment charge is calculated in the early repayment charge guide. fixed early repayment charge 39.5 the fixed early repayment charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid. the amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest. the early repayment charge percentage will reduce throughout the early repayment period. after the end of the early repayment period, an early repayment charge will not be payable. the fixed early repayment charge structure and a worked example is set out in your offer and our early repayment charge guide 40. benchmark interest rates (applicable to the variable early repayment charge only) the variable early repayment charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements. for this, we use the uk ftse 15 year gilt yield index. this index is published daily in the financial times (under gilts uk ftse actuaries indices, yield indices, 15 yrs). for each advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. your offer will show the benchmark interest rate and the target benchmark interest rate for the advance. 40.1 on any business day, we use the benchmark interest rate published on the previous business day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the business day before that.40 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "682": "31 terms and conditions 40.2 a target benchmark interest rate

apply. if a repayment is not made during the period a repayment statement remains valid, you must obtain another repayment statement from us. 40.4 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is less than the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid,

after you or each of you, if you are borrowing jointly, die or permanently leave the property for the purposes of long term care and the evidence you have provided is reasonably satisfactory to us; or b) in the case of borrowing jointly, full repayment of your lifetime mortgage happens within 3 years of the death of one of you, or of one of you permanently leaving the property for the purpose of long term care and the evidence you have provided is reasonably satisfactory to us: or c) for each advance, repayment of that advance happens after the early repayment period applicable to that advance; or d) an early repayment is within a permitted partial repayment as set out in section 38.6; or e) in the case of a variable early repayment charge, section 40.5 applies and the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is the same as, or more than, the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance: or41 call 01737 233297 or visit

lifetime mortgage to the new property; or g) you want to move home and the new property meets our lending criteria at the time, and you make a partial repayment equal to an amount required by us because the new property does not provide enough security (for example you move to a home of lesser value), provided that we allow you to transfer, and you transfer your lifetime mortgage to the new property. what happens if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement? 42. what is a breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement? if you fail to do something you agreed to do, for example insuring and maintaining the property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage agreement. this section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement. if there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home. 42.1 if you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage agreement then this is a breach. 42.2 if a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. we will allow you a reasonable time to do so. we will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender. 42.3 if you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. for example, this may require us to enter the property and carry out repairs. 42.4 if we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any costs that we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. 42.5 where we have to take action or incur costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement (whether or not we add costs to the amount owed because you have not paid them). 42.6 if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee. please see section 36.5.42 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "684": "33 terms and conditions 43. what is a default event? a default event is an event that could lead to serious consequences: for example we could require you to repay the amount owed early or it could lead to possession and sale of the

becomes payable; b) you do not repay the amount owed within 12 months from when you or each of you, if you are borrowing jointly, die, or permanently leave the property for the purpose of long term care; c) you become, or in the case of joint borrowers either of you becomes, bankrupt; d) you seriously breach your lifetime mortgage agreement and/or persistently fail to remedy a breach within a reasonable period to be determined by us; e) you leave the property continuously unoccupied for more than three months without our written permission; or f) false or incomplete information was given to us by you or anyone acting on your behalf when you applied for any advance and we reasonably believe this made a significant difference to our decision to lend to you. 43.2 you will be taken to have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage agreement where because of the breach there is or could be a significant negative effect on: a) you being able to pay us all of the amount owed at any time; b) your lifetime mortgage; c) us in relation to your lifetime mortgage; or d) the value of the property. 43.3 the following are examples of breaches that will be considered serious breaches of the lifetime mortgage agreement: a) you fail to maintain the property in accordance with section 27 above; b) you fail to pay any of the costs specified in section 24 above; or c) you fail to allow

proceedings. if you do not pay these when we ask you to, then these amounts will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. 45. appointment of a property receiver where a default event occurs we can appoint a receiver for all or part of the property. the receiver will act as your agent and this means you are responsible for their costs and their actions. we, or the receiver, can do anything that you could do with the property, such as signing documents to do with your lifetime mortgage agreement or the property. if your property is in scotland, we have rights under the standard security but these do not include appointing a receiver. we are entitled to exercise our rights and remedies ourselves. please see section 55.9. 45.1 if a default event occurs, or if the property or our security appears to be at risk (for example, another creditor takes enforcement action in respect of the property), then we have the right to appoint a receiver. we can do this without giving you any prior notice. we can also remove the receiver and choose whether or not we need to appoint another one. 45.2 none of the restrictions made by the law of property act 1925 in relation to the appointment apply. 45.3 any receiver we appoint will be regarded as your agent and you will be responsible for the receivers actions and omissions. the receiver can do anything in relation to the

other powers from section 101 of the law of property act 1925, over the property as part of your lifetime mortgage. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. 46.2 section 103 of the law of property act 1925 will not apply to your lifetime mortgage. (section 103 would otherwise restrict our powers of sale.) for example, we are not required to give you three months notice before we sell the property. 46.3 if we, or the receiver take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a mortgage lender in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the

of, or in connection with your lifetime mortgage can be settled in a court of law as set out below. 52.1 if the property is in england or wales, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of england and wales. 52.2 if the property is in scotland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of scotland. 52.3 if the property is in northern ireland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of northern ireland. 52.4 the terms of your lifetime mortgage agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the united kingdom in which the property is located. this means if the property is located in england or wales, the competent court will be the courts of england and wales. if the property is located in scotland, the competent court will be the scottish courts. if the property is located in northern ireland, the competent court will be the courts in northern ireland. 52.5 if any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way. 52.6 if any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement are not consistent with anything in an offer, the terms of the offer will apply. 53. changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement 53.1 we can make reasonable changes to your lifetime mortgage agreement in the following circumstances: a) to make the terms of the lifetime mortgage agreement easier to understand or fairer to you; b) to reflect an improvement of any service or facility we supply in connection with your mortgage; c) to introduce a new service; d) to replace an existing service with a new one (but only where this would not be to your disadvantage); e) to correct any obvious error that might be found in the future in relation to the written terms of the lifetime mortgage agreement.5352 call 01737 233297 or visit

control in the following circumstances: a) any laws and regulations we have to comply with; b) as a result of a decision by a court, ombudsman or similar body; or c) any industry guidance or code of practice we follow (where the change would not be to your disadvantage). 53.3 we will write to you at least 28 days before we have to make any changes, unless the change in the law or regulation requires us to make the change more quickly. 54. giving notice 54.1 we will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters we send will be sent to you at the property, unless you have given us another address to use. 54.2 you must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters you send must be sent to just retirement money limited at the address in the about us section, unless we have given you another address to use. 55. variations for properties in scotland due to the different legal practices, if the property is in scotland then this section will apply to you. 55.1 in section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common. if the property is in scotland, this means that the property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. in section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. in scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy. 55.2 where we refer to a legal charge, if the property is in scotland, this means a standard security under the conveyancing and feudal reform (scotland) act 1970 (the 1970 act). if we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security. 55.3 in section 8, section 22, section 23 and section 25, there are references to the property being leasehold. this is rare for a house in scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. in the unlikely event that they do, leasehold means held on a long lease and freehold means owned. forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in scotland as irritancy. in section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the property under a lease.54 55 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "691": "40 terms and conditions 55.4 a court judgement in scotland is often referred to as a decree. you will see reference to a court judgement in section 9.7. 55.5 section 15 refers to occupiers. in scotland, if the occupier is your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. this has the effect that our rights in relation to the property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have. 55.6 section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. in scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives. 55.7 section 29.3 does not apply where the property is in scotland. 55.8 if a default event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in schedule 3 to the 1970 act and we can enter into possession of the property in accordance with the 1970 act, sell the property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 act. 55.9 there is no provision in the 1970 act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in section 44.1(d), section 45, section 46 and section 47 to a receiver, do not apply. 55.10 5subject to the provisions of the 1970 act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in section 45.5, section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver. 55.11 we have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 act. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. if we take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. if we have to sell the property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. if the property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. we may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. if we sell the property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. if we sell the property and the sale proceeds of

the property permanently for the purposes of long term care. it will provide you with a cash facility and in some instances you may take additional advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet. you do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make monthly payments as described in section 10. interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or rolled-up) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property when you die or permanently leave the property for long term care. if you repay the amount owed before this time, you may need to pay an early repayment charge. 1. your lifetime mortgage agreement 1.1 your lifetime mortgage agreement with us is made up of these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions, your offer pack, mortgage deed and tariff of charges. where in these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents. 1.2 if there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority: a) your offer pack; b) tariff of charges; c) these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions; and d) mortgage deed. 2. your cash facility 2.1 we have agreed to make available to you a cash facility. the amount of your cash facility is shown in your initial advance offer. 3. your initial advance 3.1 you must take an initial advance from your cash facility for an amount agreed between us and you. the amount of the initial advance is shown in your initial advance offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage completes.11 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "705": "5 terms and conditions 4. additional advances your lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your cash facility without further approval. your most recent offer will confirm how much may be available to you. if you wish to take an additional advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the interest rate and other terms that will apply to this additional advance. if you wish to proceed we will send to you an additional advance offer. 4.1 if you have an unused cash facility, you can request an additional advance at any time while you are still living in the property. the amount of any additional advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum additional advance amount shown in your initial advance offer. additional advances are only available up to the value of the unused cash facility. 4.2 if the additional advance is available to you, we will send to you an additional advance offer which shows the terms for the additional advance including the amount of the additional advance, the interest rate and a description of any early repayment charge that will apply. the interest rate may be different to the rate applicable to the initial advance and any other additional advance(s). 4.3 if you accept the additional advance offer and we receive your acceptance before the offer expires, we will pay the amount of the additional advance to your chosen bank account when your additional advance completes. your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 if you request an additional advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the additional advance to your bank account. 4.5 additional advances will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property and are subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. 5. your unused cash facility 5.1 the amount of money left in the cash facility for you to take any additional advances from is called the unused cash facility. each time you take an advance or any fees or costs are added to the amount owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your unused cash facility will decrease. if the arrangement fee for your initial advance is added to the amount owed, that will not affect the unused cash facility. 5.2 if you take additional advances, the amount of money left in your unused cash facility will be shown in your most recent additional advance offer.4 5 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "706": "6terms and conditions 6. circumstances when you may be unable to take additional advances there are some circumstances when we may not give you an additional advance. this may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. this section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an additional advance even though you have not used all of your cash facility. 6.1 in some circumstances you will be unable to take additional advances. if, when you request an additional advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your unused cash facility will not be available to you: a) if the total of all the advances you have received exceeds the maximum loan amount based on your age and property value at the time the request for an additional advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time the request for an additional advance is made; d) if the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either party has died; e) if a default event occurs (default events are set out in section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the fca, the fca (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the additional advance;or g) if a charge has been registered on the property (see section 29.2 for more details of this restriction). 6.2 if the event in section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow additional advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. you will be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our costs, even if we do not agree to provide the additional advance, or the additional advance does not complete. 6.3 if you believe that our assessment of the value of the property in section 6.1(a) or section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified valuer to value the property. you will need to pay a valuation fee before the valuation of the property. in the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the additional advance then we will refund the valuation fee to you.6 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "707": "7 terms and conditions 7. increasing your cash facility when you have used up your cash facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing. you can apply to increase your cash facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay fees as referred to in this section. you will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser. 7.1 when you have used all of your cash facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your cash facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. any increase to your cash facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. if we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased cash facility in an additional advance offer. 7.2 if we agree to increase your cash facility, you will be able to take an additional advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new unused cash facility. after you have taken the additional advance up to the full amount of your unused cash facility, the unused cash facility will be zero. 7.3 if you decide to request an increase to your cash facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated fees. your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.4 if we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.5 we may obtain a new valuation of the property from an independent, qualified valuer. if we do, you will need to pay a non- refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property. 7.6 if you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your cash facility. also, to be eligible for an increase in your cash facility, you and the property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your cash facility.7 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "708": "8terms and conditions 8. the property as security your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property. additional advances and other amounts added to the amount owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property. 8.1 the amount owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the amount owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime. 8.2 we require a first legal charge over the property. when you have signed and accepted your offer and the mortgage deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the property at the land registry. 8.3 if the property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. 8.4 if the property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the amount owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. if we sell the property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser. 8.5 you must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else. 9. interest this section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. interest is charged daily and rolled up monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your offer. the interest rate for the initial advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make monthly payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these monthly payments, please refer to section 10.7). 9.1 the interest rate on your initial advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your initial advance offer. 9.2 the interest rate on each additional advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the additional advance. the interest rate on the additional advance could be higher or lower than the interest rate on your initial advance. we provide an additional advance offer confirming the interest rate each time we agree to provide you with an additional advance. 98 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "709": "9 terms and conditions 9.3 the interest rate shown in an offer is only available if the advance completes before that offer expires. the date an offer expires is shown in that offer. if an offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new offer, the interest rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new offer and is shown in your new offer. 9.4 the interest rate on any fees or costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the fees or costs are added. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such fees and costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 interest is charged daily at the interest rate on each amount which forms part of the amount owed, from the date that amount is added to the amount owed, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 the interest that is charged daily forms part of the amount owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged: a) for advances, from the date the relevant advance completes; or b) for any other amount (including fees and costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the amount owed. each month, the interest that is charged daily is rolled-up, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest rolls-up. 9.7 interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the amount owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before. 9.8 a lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the amount owed. call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "710": "10terms and conditions 10. monthly payments as part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make monthly payments against the amount of interest charged. the amount of your ongoing monthly payment can be set between 25 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your initial advance and any additional advances. once your monthly payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a payment holiday or stop making your monthly payments altogether. if you choose to stop making monthly payments, or fail to make the monthly payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest roll- up for the remainder of your loan. once you have stopped making monthly payments they cannot be restarted. this section explains more about your options. 10.1 at the outset of your initial advance and each additional advance you can select to make monthly payments. 10.2 for the initial advance you can choose to pay between a minimum of 25.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest. 10.3 for additional advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making monthly payments on your initial advance. 10.4 the total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the advance by the interest rate and dividing by 12. 10.5 your monthly payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month. 10.6 once you have completed you cannot change the amount of your monthly payments. 10.7 you can stop making monthly payments at any time subject to giving us 1 months written notice. once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10.8 you may request one payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following completion of the initial advance, providing you give us 1 months written notice. interest not paid during a payment holiday will be added to the amount owed and interest will roll up on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage. 10.9 if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment for any month within 3 working days of the next monthly payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting monthly payments and you will not be able to re-start them. this means the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "711": "11 terms and conditions 1110.10 you cannot increase or decrease the amount of monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage once your lifetime mortgage has commenced. 10.11 if you make a partial repayment on your lifetime mortgage we may reduce the amount of your monthly payment to reflect the change in the amount owed and ensure you are not paying more than the interest due. 10.12 all monthly payments must be made in sterling. if any monthly payment falls due on a day which is not a business day, we will collect on the next business day. 11. fees that you may need to pay throughout this booklet we refer to fees that you may need to pay to us. this section tells you more about fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the fees will be. 11.1 the fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these fees are payable are described in your initial advance offer. 11.2 the fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an additional advance and when these fees are payable are described in each additional advance offer. 11.3 other fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the tariff of charges. from time to time, we may review the fees that we charge and we may add new fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect : 11.3.1 a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services; or 11.3.2 any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business. 11.4 if we change the fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new tariff of charges. 12. costs that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. you may also need to pay costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical costs that may arise. 12.1 you must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "712": "12terms and conditions 12.2 you must pay the reasonable costs that we incur during your lifetime mortgage and we will tell you at least 28 days before you need to pay us. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 12.3 where we add fees or costs to the amount owed, they will be treated in the same way as advances for the purposes of charging interest and early repayment charges, determining how much of your unused cash facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the amount owed. 13. the term of your lifetime mortgage 13.1 your offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. the term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage agreement continues to apply until the amount owed is repaid in full. 14. special conditions in some instances we may need to apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage. these special conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the property as recommended by the valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. 14.1 we may apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these special conditions are set out in your offer. special conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve the conflict. 14.2 we may ask you to satisfy special conditions before your lifetime mortgage completes. where special conditions require you to take some action in relation to the property after your lifetime mortgage completes you will have 6 months from the date of completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing. 14.3 we may require you to provide documents to confirm that a special condition in relation to the property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the property. you may need to pay a non- refundable fee for this re-inspection.1413 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "713": "13 terms and

reasonable for us to refuse permission for something that we reasonably think would have a negative effect on: a) you being able to pay us all of the amount owed at any time; b) your lifetime mortgage; c) the value of the property; or d) us in relation to your lifetime mortgage. 16.4 we will act reasonably when we: a) have the power to take action; b) require you to do something or not do

interest as a mortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary. 25.1 you must keep the property fully insured against loss or damage with a reputable insurance company we approve of. sometimes you will not be able to insure the property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. an example of that would be if the property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. in that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it. 25.2 the insurance policy must: a) be with a reputable insurer; b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the property, which is designed to cover the amount (including value added tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the property, clear the site of the property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and pay for alternative accommodation; c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the house rebuilding cost index or such other index as we reasonably require; d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require; e) if you are purchasing the property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever is the earliest; and f) if you are re-mortgaging the property, be on risk at least two business days before completion of your lifetime mortgage. 25.3 our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. if we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). in the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 you must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy. 25.5 you must pay the insurance premiums on time. you must show us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are

the property is no longer insured, or the insurance is not suitable, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to insure the property. if we insure the property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. you will need to pay the costs that we incur in insuring the property. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those

a claim on your insurance you must tell the insurance company as soon as possible and assist the insurance company to resolve the claim. 26.4 we may also make a claim on your insurance and negotiate and settle any claims on your behalf. 26.5 the claims money must be used to make good any loss or damage it has been paid for, or if we agree with you, it will be used to reduce or repay the amount owed. if there has been significant loss or damage to the property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us. 27. maintaining the property you will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the property. we will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the property to

changes to the property you must tell us if you wish to alter the property. we will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the property, but we have put in place safeguards. these safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard. 28.1 you must not alter the property structurally, extend or convert the property or change the use of the property unless you have our written permission to do so. you will be responsible for paying for the cost

to pay a non-refundable fee for this. 29. other secured borrowing your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the property. other lenders may not be willing to lend to you because we have a first charge on the property and the amount owed will increase due to the

exercise any of the powers given to us by your lifetime mortgage agreement or under the law. this includes you signing any appropriate documents or deeds relating to the property. 30.2 you must ensure

with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event. you might also need to repay early if there is a default event, which is described in section 43 of this booklet. 35.1 you can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. the amount owed, including all of the interest, fees and costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the property, although the amount owed can be repaid from other funds. 35.2 a repayment event will occur when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. the amount owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the repayment event. you must tell us as soon as possible in writing if a repayment event occurs. 35.3 in the event of your

even if these are less than the amount owed. there is no additional charge for this guarantee. this section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply. 36.1 you must seek our written permission before you sell the property. if we reasonably believe that the anticipated sale proceeds might be less than the amount owed, including any early repayment charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified valuer to assess the property value. you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation is carried out. 36.2 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, we will accept the sale proceeds as full repayment of the amount owed. if you have breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, then the terms of section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee. 36.3 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the property. if we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the sale proceeds are not enough to cover the amount owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the sale proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the amount owed. 36.4 in the case of any proposed sale of the property, if we reasonably believe that the sale proceeds will be less than the amount owed, we may spend money on the property in order to make it more marketable. this may include paying for further valuations of the property. any amount we spend under this section will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. we will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). we will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the property is sold. if we are unable to sell the property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 if you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the property has been reduced, and/or the amount owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the sale proceeds being less than the amount owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. in this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the sale proceeds and the amount owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage agreement.36 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "727": "27 terms and conditions 36.6 if an independent valuation carried out following a repayment event

repayment. section 38.7 does not apply if you are making monthly payments and so any partial repayment you choose to make whilst making monthly payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an early repayment charge. 38.3 we will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. this does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the property. 38.4 if there is any partial repayment it will reduce the amount owed immediately. if you have more than one advance, or costs and fees have been added to the amount owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your advances, and the costs and fees that have been added (excluding any early repayment charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 if you are making monthly payments, as detailed within section 10, then section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge if those repayments are within the early repayment period. 38.6 partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the advance without being subject to an early repayment charge provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:38 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "729": "29 terms and conditions a) the total value of partial repayments received in the relevant 12 month period in respect of the advance in question does not exceed 10% of that advance; b) no more than a total of 6 partial repayments are made in the relevant 12 month period; c) each partial repayment is 500 or more; and d) the partial repayment does not result in reducing the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. if you have more than one advance, the amount of the partial repayment will be allocated between the advances in proportion to the amount you owe on each advance. 38.7 partial repayments will be allocated as follows: a) if the partial repayment meets the conditions in section 38.6, no early repayment charge applies. any partial repayment will be allocated between advances and any fees and costs in proportion to the advance and fees and costs when compared to the amount owed. the partial repayment will be allocated between capital and interest. this split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest). b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in section 38.6, an early repayment charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the early repayment period. this charge could be zero . if this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. if the early repayment charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above. 39. early repayment charges if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an early repayment charge. this is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. the early repayment charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we offer a two different early repayment charge options; variable and fixed. the type of early repayment charge must be chosen at outset. once the initial advance has completed, the type of early repayment charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the initial advance and all subsequent advances. please refer to your offer letter to understand which option applies to your lifetime mortgage. further details on the early repayment charge, including cash examples are included in your initial advance offer and each additional advance offer. the guide to our early repayment charge contains helpful information about early repayment charges.39 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "730": "30terms and conditions 39.1 the early repayment charge is charged against each advance you receive from your cash facility to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a repayment event. fees and costs may be applied to the advance and these will increase the amount owed. please refer to the definitions section for details on when fees and costs may be applied. the early repayment charge will be applied to the total amount owed. 39.2 a maximum early repayment charge will apply to your initial advance and will be shown in your initial advance offer a maximum early repayment charge will also apply to each additional advance and will be shown in each additional advance offer 39.3 if you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your early repayment charge payable at that time. variable early repayment charge 39.4 the variable early repayment charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining early repayment period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements). the way we calculate the variable early repayment charge is set out in your offer. we have set out a worked example of how the variable early repayment charge is calculated in the early repayment charge guide. fixed early repayment charge 39.5 the fixed early repayment charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid. the amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest. the early repayment charge percentage will reduce throughout the early repayment period. after the end of the early repayment period, an early repayment charge will not be payable. the fixed early repayment charge structure and a worked example is set out in your offer and our early repayment charge guide 40. benchmark interest rates (applicable to the variable early repayment charge only) the variable early repayment charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements. for this, we use the uk ftse 15 year gilt yield index. this index is published daily in the financial times (under gilts uk ftse actuaries indices, yield indices, 15 yrs). for each advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. your offer will show the benchmark interest rate and the target benchmark interest rate for the advance. 40.1 on any business day, we use the benchmark interest rate published on the previous business day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the business day before that.40 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "731": "31 terms and conditions 40.2 a target benchmark interest rate applies to your initial advance and is shown in your initial advance offer. a target benchmark interest rate also applies to each additional advance and is shown in each additional advance offer. 40.3

apply. if a repayment is not made during the period a repayment statement remains valid, you must obtain another repayment statement from us. 40.4 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is less than the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is payable for that advance. an illustration of this early repayment charge is contained in your offer. 40.5 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is the same as, or more than, the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is not payable for that advance. 40.6 your offer provides a table of early repayment charge cash examples for particular movements in the benchmark interest rate and you should refer to the worked example mentioned in section 39.4 above for an illustration of how the movements in the benchmark interest rate affects the early repayment charge. 41. circumstances when early repayment charges do not apply early repayment charges only apply if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early, but even if it is repaid early you may not have to pay an early repayment charge. this section describes the circumstances when you do not have to pay an early repayment charge. 41.1 an early repayment charge is not payable if: a) repayment of your lifetime mortgage happens

advance; or d) an early repayment is within a permitted partial repayment as set out in section 38.6; or e) in the case of a variable early repayment charge, section 40.5 applies and the benchmark

maintaining the property, or if you do something you are not allowed to do, for example renting out the property, then you will breach your lifetime mortgage agreement. this section explains what a breach is and what could happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement. if there is a breach this could affect our decision when you request our permission under your lifetime mortgage agreement, for example, if you want to transfer your lifetime mortgage to a new property when moving home. 42.1 if you fail to comply with your lifetime mortgage agreement then this is a breach. 42.2 if a breach occurs we may ask you to take action to remedy the breach. we will allow you a reasonable time to do so. we will take into account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender. 42.3 if you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. for example, this may require us to enter the property and carry out repairs. 42.4 if we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any costs that we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. 42.5 where we have to take action or incur costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement (whether or not we add costs to the amount owed because you have not paid them). 42.6 if you breach your

time; b) your lifetime mortgage; c) us in relation to your lifetime mortgage; or d) the value of the property. 43.3 the following are examples of breaches that will be considered serious breaches of

security but these do not include appointing a receiver. we are entitled to exercise our rights and remedies ourselves. please see section 55.9. 45.1 if a default event occurs, or if the property or

any prior notice. we can also remove the receiver and choose whether or not we need to appoint another one. 45.2 none of the restrictions made by the law of property act 1925 in relation to the

laws of england and wales. 52.2 if the property is in scotland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of scotland. 52.3 if the property is in northern ireland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of northern ireland. 52.4 the terms of your lifetime mortgage agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the united kingdom in which the property is located. this means if the property is located in england or wales, the competent court will be the courts of england and wales. if the property is located in

we send will be sent to you at the property, unless you have given us another address to use. 54.2 you must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your

for properties in scotland due to the different legal practices, if the property is in scotland then this section will apply to you. 55.1 in section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common. if the property is in scotland, this means that the property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. in section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. in scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy. 55.2 where we refer to a legal charge, if the property is in scotland, this means a standard security under the conveyancing and feudal reform (scotland) act 1970 (the 1970 act). if we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security. 55.3 in section 8, section 22, section 23 and section 25, there are references to the property being leasehold. this is rare for a house in scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. in the unlikely event that they do, leasehold means held on a long lease and freehold means owned. forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in scotland as irritancy. in section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the property under a lease.54 55 call 01737 233297

15 refers to occupiers. in scotland, if the occupier is your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. this has the effect that our rights in relation to the property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have. 55.6

1970 act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in section 44.1(d), section 45, section 46 and section 47 to a receiver, do not apply. 55.10 5subject to the provisions of the 1970 act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in section 45.5, section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver. 55.11 we have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 act. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. if we take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. if we have to sell the property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. if the property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. we may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a

"4terms and conditions 2 3about your lifetime mortgage your lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan designed to run for the rest of your life or until you have to leave the property permanently for the purposes of long term care. it will provide you with a cash facility and in some instances you may take additional advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet. you do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make monthly payments as described in section 10. interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or rolled-up) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property when you die or permanently leave the property for long term care. if you repay the amount owed before this time, you may need to pay an early repayment charge. 1. your lifetime mortgage agreement 1.1 your lifetime mortgage agreement with us is made up of these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions, your offer pack, mortgage deed and tariff of charges. where in these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents. 1.2 if there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority: a) your offer pack; b) tariff of charges; c) these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions; and d) mortgage deed. 2. your cash facility 2.1 we have agreed to make available to you a cash facility. the amount of your cash facility is shown in your initial advance offer. 3. your initial advance 3.1 you must take an initial advance from your cash facility for an amount agreed between us and you. the amount of the initial advance is shown in your initial advance offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage completes.11 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "769": "5 terms and conditions 4. additional advances your lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your cash facility without further approval. your most recent offer will confirm how much may be available to you. if you wish to take an additional advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the interest rate and other terms that will apply to this additional advance. if you wish to proceed we will send to you an additional advance offer. 4.1 if you have an unused cash facility, you can request an additional advance at any time while you are still living in the property. the amount of any additional advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum additional advance amount shown in your initial advance offer. additional advances are only available up to the value of the unused cash facility. 4.2 if the additional advance is available to you, we will send to you an additional advance offer which shows the terms for the additional advance including the amount of the additional advance, the interest rate and a description of any early repayment charge that will apply. the interest rate may be different to the rate applicable to the initial advance and any other additional advance(s). 4.3 if you accept the additional advance offer and we receive your acceptance before the offer expires, we will pay the amount of the additional advance to your chosen bank account when your additional advance completes. your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 if you request an additional advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the additional advance to your bank account. 4.5 additional advances will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property and are subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. 5. your unused cash facility 5.1 the amount of money left in the cash facility for you to take any additional advances from is called the unused cash facility. each time you take an advance or any fees or costs are added to the amount owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your unused cash facility will decrease. if the arrangement fee for your initial advance is added to the amount owed, that will not affect the unused cash facility. 5.2 if you take additional advances, the amount of money left in your unused cash facility will be shown in your most recent additional advance offer.4 5 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "770": "6terms and conditions 6. circumstances when you may be unable to take additional advances there are some circumstances when we may not give you an additional advance. this may happen if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. this section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an additional advance even though you have not used all of your cash facility. 6.1 in some circumstances you will be unable to take additional advances. if, when you request an additional advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your unused cash facility will not be available to you: a) if the total of all the advances you have received exceeds the maximum loan amount based on your age and property value at the time the request for an additional advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time the request for an additional advance is made; d) if the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either party has died; e) if a default event occurs (default events are set out in section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the fca, the fca (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the additional advance;or g) if a charge has been registered on the property (see section 29.2 for more details of this restriction). 6.2 if the event in section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow additional advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. you will be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our costs, even if we do not agree to provide the additional advance, or the additional advance does not complete. 6.3 if you believe that our assessment of the value of the property in section 6.1(a) or section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified valuer to value the property. you will need to pay a valuation fee before the valuation of the property. in the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the additional advance then we will refund the valuation fee to you.6 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "771": "7 terms and conditions 7. increasing your cash facility when you have used up your cash facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing. you can apply to increase your cash facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay fees as referred to in this section. you will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser. 7.1 when you have used all of your cash facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your cash facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. any increase to your cash facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. if we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased cash facility in an additional advance offer. 7.2 if we agree to increase your cash facility, you will be able to take an additional advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new unused cash facility. after you have taken the additional advance up to the full amount of your unused cash facility, the unused cash facility will be zero. 7.3 if you decide to request an increase to your cash facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated fees. your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.4 if we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.5 we may obtain a new valuation of the property from an independent, qualified valuer. if we do, you will need to pay a non- refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property. 7.6 if you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your cash facility. also, to be eligible for an increase in your cash facility, you and the property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your cash facility.7 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "772": "8terms and conditions 8. the property as security your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property. additional advances and other amounts added to the amount owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property. 8.1 the amount owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the amount owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime. 8.2 we require a first legal charge over the property. when you have signed and accepted your offer and the mortgage deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the property at the land registry. 8.3 if the property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. 8.4 if the property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the amount owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. if we sell the property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser. 8.5 you must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else. 9. interest this section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. interest is charged daily and rolled up monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your offer. the interest rate for the initial advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make monthly payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these monthly payments, please refer to section 10.7). 9.1 the interest rate on your initial advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your initial advance offer. 9.2 the interest rate on each additional advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the additional advance. the interest rate on the additional advance could be higher or lower than the interest rate on your initial advance. we provide an additional advance offer confirming the interest rate each time we agree to provide you with an additional advance. 98 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "773": "9 terms and conditions 9.3 the interest rate shown in an offer is only available if the advance completes before that offer expires. the date an offer expires is shown in that offer. if an offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new offer, the interest rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new offer and is shown in your new offer. 9.4 the interest rate on any fees or costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the fees or costs are added. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such fees and costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 interest is charged daily at the interest rate on each amount which forms part of the amount owed, from the date that amount is added to the amount owed, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 the interest that is charged daily forms part of the amount owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged: a) for advances, from the date the relevant advance completes; or b) for any other amount (including fees and costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the amount owed. each month, the interest that is charged daily is rolled-up, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest rolls-up. 9.7 interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the amount owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before. 9.8 a lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the amount owed. call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "774": "10terms and conditions 10. monthly payments as part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make monthly payments against the amount of interest charged. the amount of your ongoing monthly payment can be set between 25 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your initial advance and any additional advances. once your monthly payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a payment holiday or stop making your monthly payments altogether. if you choose to stop making monthly payments, or fail to make the monthly payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest roll- up for the remainder of your loan. once you have stopped making monthly payments they cannot be restarted. this section explains more about your options. 10.1 at the outset of your initial advance and each additional advance you can select to make monthly payments. 10.2 for the initial advance you can choose to pay between a minimum of 25.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest. 10.3 for additional advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making monthly payments on your initial advance. 10.4 the total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the advance by the interest rate and dividing by 12. 10.5 your monthly payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month. 10.6 once you have completed you cannot change the amount of your monthly payments. 10.7 you can stop making monthly payments at any time subject to giving us 1 months written notice. once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10.8 you may request one payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following completion of the initial advance, providing you give us 1 months written notice. interest not paid during a payment holiday will be added to the amount owed and interest will roll up on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage. 10.9 if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment for any month within 3 working days of the next monthly payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting monthly payments and you will not be able to re-start them. this means the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "775": "11 terms and conditions 1110.10 you cannot increase or decrease the amount of monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage once your lifetime mortgage has commenced. 10.11 if you make a partial repayment on your lifetime mortgage we may reduce the amount of your monthly payment to reflect the change in the amount owed and ensure you are not paying more than the interest due. 10.12 all monthly payments must be made in sterling. if any monthly payment falls due on a day which is not a business day, we will collect on the next business day. 11. fees that you may need to pay throughout this booklet we refer to fees that you may need to pay to us. this section tells you more about fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the fees will be. 11.1 the fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these fees are payable are described in your initial advance offer. 11.2 the fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an additional advance and when these fees are payable are described in each additional advance offer. 11.3 other fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the tariff of charges. from time to time, we may review the fees that we charge and we may add new fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect : 11.3.1 a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services; or 11.3.2 any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business. 11.4 if we change the fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new tariff of charges. 12. costs that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. you may also need to pay costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical costs that may arise. 12.1 you must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "776": "12terms and conditions 12.2 you must pay the reasonable costs that we

notified of the interest rate applicable to such costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 12.3 where we add fees or costs to the amount owed, they will be treated in the same way as advances for the purposes of charging interest and early repayment charges, determining how much of your unused cash facility

lifetime mortgage agreement continues to apply until the amount owed is repaid in full. 14. special conditions in some instances we may need to apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage. these special conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the property as recommended by the valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. 14.1 we may apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these special conditions are set out in your offer. special conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve the conflict. 14.2 we may ask you to satisfy special conditions before your lifetime mortgage completes. where special conditions require you to take some action in relation to the property after your lifetime mortgage completes you will have 6 months from the date of completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing. 14.3 we may require you to provide documents to confirm that a special condition in relation to the property has been

of. sometimes you will not be able to insure the property yourself because someone else has the legal right to insure it. an example of that would be if the property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or management company to insure it. in that case, you must do all you reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management company insures it. 25.2 the insurance policy must: a) be with a reputable insurer; b) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report for the rebuilding cost of the property, which is designed to cover the amount (including value added tax) required to demolish and/or rebuild the property, clear the site of the property, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and pay for alternative accommodation; c) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in accordance with the house rebuilding cost index or such other index as we reasonably require; d) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from time to time reasonably require; e) if you are purchasing the property, be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts, or the date on which the advance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever is the earliest; and f) if you are re-mortgaging the property, be on risk at least two business days before completion of your lifetime mortgage. 25.3 our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance policy. if we have a valid reason, for example there has been a change in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as joint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) or co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the insurance will be distinct). in the event we request cover on a joint insured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you with details of the type of policy we require. 25.4 you must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or which might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or reduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example giving false information to your insurer or leaving the property unoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the insurance policy. 25.5 you must pay the insurance premiums on time. you must show us your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are

the property is no longer insured, or the insurance is not suitable, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to insure the property. if we insure the property, we will only insure our interest and not yours. you will need to pay the costs that we incur in insuring the property. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those

owed. if there has been significant loss or damage to the property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us. 27. maintaining the property you will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the property. we will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the property to

even if these are less than the amount owed. there is no additional charge for this guarantee. this section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply. 36.1 you must seek our written permission before you sell the property. if we reasonably believe that the anticipated sale proceeds might be less than the amount owed, including any early repayment charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified valuer to assess the property value. you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation is carried out. 36.2 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, we will accept the sale proceeds as full repayment of the amount owed. if you have breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, then the terms of section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee. 36.3 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the property. if we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the sale proceeds are not enough to cover the amount owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the sale proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the amount owed. 36.4 in the case of any proposed sale of the property, if we reasonably believe that the sale proceeds will be less than the amount owed, we may spend money on the property in order to make it more marketable. this may include paying for further valuations of the property. any amount we spend under this section will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. we will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). we will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the property is sold. if we are unable to sell the property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 if you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the property has been reduced, and/or the amount owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the sale proceeds being less than the amount owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. in this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the sale proceeds and the amount owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage agreement.36 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "791": "27 terms and conditions 36.6 if an independent valuation carried out following a repayment event confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds are less than the amount owed, then we have the right to sell the property and use the sale proceeds towards repaying the amount owed. you must co-operate with us to achieve the best price reasonably obtainable for the property. what if you repay early? 37. early repayment your lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. if you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, and repayment of an advance happens during the early repayment period which is set out in the offer for that advance, you may have to pay a substantial early repayment charge when you repay. this is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a repayment event. if you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any early repayment charge payable at that time. you should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 37.1 if you repay all or part of the amount owed before a repayment event as explained in section 35 (which explains when a repayment event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. you can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an early repayment charge as set out in more detail below. early repayment charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in section 41. 37.2 we require at least 14 days written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we will then calculate the amount owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any early repayment charge due at that time). 37.3 you can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the amount owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period. 37.4 if the amount owed is repaid as a result of a default event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an early repayment charge may be payable.37 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "792": "28terms and conditions 38. partial repayment you are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, subject to certain limits specified in the offer pack and as set out in section 38.7 below, but you may have to pay an early repayment charge on any partial repayment that you make in excess of these limits. making a partial repayment will not increase your unused cash facility, but may reduce your cash facility. if you are making monthly payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge and section 38.7 will not apply. you should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 38.1 if there is any repayment of part of the amount owed, we may reduce your cash facility and you may have to pay an early repayment charge. 38.2 each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your initial advance offer unless the conditions set out in section 38.7 are met in respect of that partial repayment. section 38.7 does not apply if you are making monthly payments and so any partial repayment you choose to make whilst making monthly payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an early repayment charge. 38.3 we will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. this does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the property. 38.4 if there is any partial repayment it will reduce the amount owed immediately. if you have more than one advance, or costs and fees have been added to the amount owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your advances, and the costs and fees that have been added (excluding any early repayment charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 if you are making monthly payments, as detailed within section 10, then section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge if those repayments are within the early repayment period. 38.6 partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period following the date of the advance without being subject to an early repayment charge provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:38 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "793":

total of 6 partial repayments are made in the relevant 12 month period; c) each partial repayment is 500 or more; and d) the partial repayment does not result in reducing the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. if you have more than one advance, the amount of the partial repayment will be allocated between the advances in proportion to the amount you owe on each advance. 38.7 partial repayments will be allocated as follows: a) if the partial repayment meets the conditions in section 38.6, no early repayment charge applies. any partial repayment will be allocated between advances and any fees and costs in proportion to the advance and fees and costs when compared to the amount owed. the partial repayment will be allocated between capital and interest. this split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest). b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in section 38.6, an early repayment charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the early repayment period. this charge could be zero . if this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. if the early repayment charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above. 39. early repayment charges if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an early repayment charge. this is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. the early repayment charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we offer a two different early repayment charge options; variable and fixed. the type of early repayment charge must be chosen at outset. once the initial advance has completed, the type of early repayment charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the initial advance and all subsequent advances. please refer to your offer letter to understand which option applies to your lifetime mortgage. further details on the early repayment charge, including cash examples are included in your initial advance offer and each additional advance offer. the guide to our early repayment charge contains helpful information about early repayment charges.39 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "794": "30terms and conditions 39.1 the early repayment charge is charged against each advance you receive from your cash facility to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a repayment event. fees and costs may be applied to the advance and these will increase the amount owed. please refer to the definitions section for details on when fees and costs may be applied. the early repayment charge will be applied to the total amount owed. 39.2 a maximum early repayment charge will apply to your initial advance and will be shown in your initial advance offer a maximum early repayment charge will also apply to each additional advance and will be shown in each additional advance offer 39.3 if you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your early repayment charge payable at that time. variable early repayment charge 39.4 the variable early repayment charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining early repayment period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements). the way we calculate the variable early repayment charge is set out in your offer. we have set out a worked example of how the variable early repayment charge is calculated in the early repayment charge guide. fixed early repayment charge 39.5 the fixed early repayment charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid. the amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest. the early repayment charge percentage will reduce throughout the early repayment period. after the end of the early repayment period, an early repayment charge will not be payable. the fixed early repayment charge structure and a worked example is set out in your offer and our early repayment charge guide 40. benchmark interest rates (applicable to the variable early repayment charge only) the variable early repayment charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements. for this, we use the uk ftse 15 year gilt yield index. this index is published daily in the financial times (under gilts uk ftse actuaries indices, yield indices, 15 yrs). for each advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. your offer will show the benchmark interest rate and the target benchmark interest rate for the advance. 40.1 on any business day, we use the benchmark interest rate published on the previous business day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the business day before that.40 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "795": "31 terms and conditions 40.2 a target benchmark interest rate applies to your initial advance and is shown in your initial advance offer. a target benchmark interest rate also applies to each additional advance and is shown in each additional advance offer. 40.3 you must ask us for a repayment statement before you make a repayment. a repayment needs to be made during the period a repayment statement remains valid for the figures shown in the statement to apply. if a repayment is not made during the period a repayment statement remains valid, you must obtain another repayment statement from us. 40.4 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is less than the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is payable for that advance. an illustration of this early repayment charge is contained in your offer. 40.5 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is the same as, or more than, the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is not payable for that advance. 40.6 your offer provides a table of early repayment charge cash examples for particular movements in the benchmark interest rate and you should refer to the worked example mentioned in section 39.4 above for an illustration of how the movements in the benchmark interest rate affects the early repayment charge. 41. circumstances

charge. this section describes the circumstances when you do not have to pay an early repayment charge. 41.1 an early repayment charge is not payable if: a) repayment of your lifetime mortgage happens

and carry out repairs. 42.4 if we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any costs that we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. 42.5 where we have to take action or incur costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement (whether or not we add costs to the amount owed because you have not paid them). 42.6 if you breach your

you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. in section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. in scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy. 55.2 where we refer to a legal charge, if the property is in scotland, this means a standard security under the conveyancing and feudal reform (scotland) act 1970 (the 1970 act). if we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security. 55.3 in section 8, section 22, section 23 and section 25, there are references to the property being leasehold. this is rare for a house in scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. in the unlikely event that they do, leasehold means held on a long lease and freehold means owned. forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in scotland as irritancy. in section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the property under a lease.54 55 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "804": "40 terms and conditions 55.4 a court judgement in scotland is often referred to as a decree. you will see reference to a court judgement in section 9.7. 55.5 section 15 refers to occupiers. in scotland, if the occupier is your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. this has the effect that our rights in relation to the property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have. 55.6 section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. in scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives. 55.7 section 29.3 does not apply where the property is in scotland. 55.8 if a default event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in schedule 3 to the 1970 act and we can enter into possession of the property in accordance with the 1970 act, sell the property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 act. 55.9 there is no provision in the 1970 act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in section 44.1(d), section 45, section 46 and section 47 to a receiver, do not apply. 55.10 5subject to the provisions of the 1970 act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in section 45.5, section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver. 55.11 we have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 act. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. if we take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. if we have to sell the property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. if the property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. we may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. if we sell the property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. if we sell the property and the sale proceeds of the property exceed the amount owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries. call 01737 233297 or visit

the property permanently for the purposes of long term care. it will provide you with a cash facility and in some instances you may take additional advances at any time without further approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet. you do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make monthly payments as described in section 10. interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or rolled-up) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property when you die or permanently leave the property for long term care. if you repay the amount owed before this time, you may need to pay an early repayment charge. 1. your lifetime mortgage agreement 1.1 your lifetime mortgage agreement with us is made up of these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions, your offer pack, mortgage deed and tariff of charges. where in these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage agreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of these documents. 1.2 if there is any inconsistency between these documents, the documents apply in the following order of priority: a) your offer pack; b) tariff of charges; c) these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions; and d) mortgage deed. 2. your cash facility 2.1 we have agreed to make available to you a cash facility. the amount of your cash facility is shown in your initial advance offer. 3. your initial advance 3.1 you must take an initial advance from your cash facility for an amount agreed between us and you. the amount of the initial advance is shown in your initial advance offer and will be paid to your legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage completes.11 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "818": "5 terms and conditions 4. additional advances your lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional borrowing from your cash facility without further approval. your most recent offer will confirm how much may be available to you. if you wish to take an additional advance you should tell us how much you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is available and the interest rate and other terms that will apply to this additional advance. if you wish to proceed we will send to you an additional advance offer. 4.1 if you have an unused cash facility, you can request an additional advance at any time while you are still living in the property. the amount of any additional advance which is requested must be for at least the minimum additional advance amount shown in your initial advance offer. additional advances are only available up to the value of the unused cash facility. 4.2 if the additional advance is available to you, we will send to you an additional advance offer which shows the terms for the additional advance including the amount of the additional advance, the interest rate and a description of any early repayment charge that will apply. the interest rate may be different to the rate applicable to the initial advance and any other additional advance(s). 4.3 if you accept the additional advance offer and we receive your acceptance before the offer expires, we will pay the amount of the additional advance to your chosen bank account when your additional advance completes. your chosen bank account must be in your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at least one of you. 4.4 if you request an additional advance you may cancel your request at any time before we transfer the additional advance to your bank account. 4.5 additional advances will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property and are subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. 5. your unused cash facility 5.1 the amount of money left in the cash facility for you to take any additional advances from is called the unused cash facility. each time you take an advance or any fees or costs are added to the amount owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your unused cash facility will decrease. if the arrangement fee for your initial advance is added to the amount owed, that will not affect the unused cash facility. 5.2

breach your lifetime mortgage agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. this section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an additional advance even though you have not used all of your cash facility. 6.1 in some circumstances you will be unable to take additional advances. if, when you request an additional advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your unused cash facility will not be available to you: a) if the total of all the advances you have received exceeds the maximum loan amount based on your age and property value at the time the request for an additional advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time the request for an additional advance is made; d) if the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either party has died; e) if a default event occurs (default events are set out in section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the fca, the fca (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the additional advance;or g) if a charge has been registered on the property (see section 29.2 for more details of this restriction). 6.2 if the event in section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow additional advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. you will be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our costs, even if we do not agree to provide the additional advance, or the additional advance does not complete. 6.3 if you believe that our assessment of the value of the property in section 6.1(a) or section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified valuer to value the property. you will need to pay a valuation fee before the valuation of the property. in the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the additional advance then we will refund the valuation fee to you.6 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "820": "7 terms and conditions 7. increasing your cash facility when you have used up your cash facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing. you can apply to increase your cash facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay fees as referred to in this section. you will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser. 7.1 when you have used all of your cash facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your cash facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. any increase to your cash facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. if we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased cash facility in an additional advance offer. 7.2 if we agree to increase your cash facility, you will be able to take an additional advance at the same time for up to the full amount of your new unused cash facility. after you have taken the additional advance up to the full amount of your unused cash facility, the unused cash facility will be zero. 7.3 if you decide to request an increase to your cash facility you will need to contact your financial adviser, complete an application form and pay all the associated fees. your financial adviser may also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.4 if we ask, you must also have legal advice from an independent legal adviser. your legal adviser will also charge you a fee for their advice. 7.5 we may obtain a new valuation of the property from an independent, qualified valuer. if we do, you will need to pay a non- refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property. 7.6 if you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your cash facility. also, to be eligible for an increase in your cash facility, you and the property must meet our lending criteria at the time you apply to increase the amount of your cash facility.7 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "821": "8terms and conditions 8. the property as security your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property. additional advances and other amounts added to the amount owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property. 8.1 the amount owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the amount owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime. 8.2 we require a first legal charge over the property. when you have signed and accepted your offer and the mortgage deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the property at the land registry. 8.3 if the property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. 8.4 if the property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the amount owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. if we sell the property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser. 8.5 you must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else. 9. interest this section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. interest is charged daily and rolled up monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your offer. the interest rate for the initial advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make monthly payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these monthly payments, please refer to section 10.7). 9.1 the interest rate on your initial advance is a fixed interest

rate on the additional advance could be higher or lower than the interest rate on your initial advance. we provide an additional advance offer confirming the interest rate each time we agree to provide you with an additional advance. 98 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "822": "9 terms and conditions 9.3 the interest rate shown in an offer is only available if the advance completes before that offer expires. the date an offer expires is shown in that offer. if an offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new offer, the interest rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new offer and is shown in your new offer. 9.4 the interest rate on any fees or costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the fees or costs are added. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such fees and costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 interest is charged daily at the interest rate on each amount which forms part of the amount owed, from the date that amount is added to the amount owed, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 the interest

mortgage you can agree to make monthly payments against the amount of interest charged. the amount of your ongoing monthly payment can be set between 25 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your initial advance and any additional advances. once your monthly payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a payment holiday or stop making your monthly payments altogether. if you choose to stop making monthly payments, or fail to make the monthly payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest roll- up for the remainder of your loan. once you have stopped making monthly payments they cannot be restarted. this section explains more about your options. 10.1 at the outset of your initial advance and each additional advance you can select to make monthly payments. 10.2 for the initial advance you can choose to pay between a minimum of 25.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest. 10.3 for additional advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making monthly payments on your initial advance. 10.4 the total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the advance by the interest rate and dividing by 12. 10.5 your monthly payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month. 10.6 once you have completed you cannot change the amount of your monthly payments. 10.7 you can stop making monthly payments at any time subject to giving us 1 months written notice. once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10.8 you may request one payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following completion of the initial advance, providing you give us 1 months written notice. interest not paid during a payment holiday will be added to the amount owed and interest will roll up on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage. 10.9 if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment for any month within 3 working days of the next monthly payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting monthly payments and you will not be able to re-start them. this means the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "824": "11 terms and conditions 1110.10 you cannot increase or decrease the amount of monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage once your lifetime mortgage has commenced. 10.11 if you make a partial repayment on your lifetime mortgage we may reduce the amount of your monthly payment to reflect the change in the amount owed and ensure you are not paying more than the interest due. 10.12 all monthly payments must be made in sterling. if any monthly payment falls due on a day which is not a business day, we will collect on the next business day. 11. fees that you may need to pay throughout this booklet we refer to fees that you may need to pay to us. this section tells you more about fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the fees will be. 11.1 the fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these fees are payable are described in your initial advance offer. 11.2 the fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an additional advance and when these fees are payable are described in each additional advance offer. 11.3 other fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the tariff of charges. from time to time, we may review the fees that we charge and we may add new fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect : 11.3.1 a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services; or 11.3.2 any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business. 11.4 if we change the fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new tariff of charges. 12. costs that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. you may also need to pay costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical costs that may arise. 12.1 you must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "825": "12terms and conditions 12.2 you must pay the reasonable costs that we

notified of the interest rate applicable to such costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 12.3 where we add fees or costs to the amount owed, they will be treated in the same way as advances for the purposes of charging interest and early repayment charges, determining how much of your unused cash facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the amount owed. 13. the term of your lifetime mortgage 13.1 your offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. the term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage agreement continues to apply until the amount owed is repaid in full. 14. special conditions in some instances we may need to apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage. these special conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the property as recommended by the valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. 14.1 we may apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these special conditions are set out in your offer. special conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve the conflict. 14.2 we may ask you to satisfy special conditions before your lifetime mortgage completes. where special conditions require you to take some action in relation to the property after your lifetime mortgage completes you will have 6 months from the date of completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing. 14.3 we may require you to provide documents to confirm that a special condition in relation to the property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the property. you may need to pay a non- refundable fee for this re-inspection.1413 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "826": "13 terms and

mortgage; c) the value of the property; or d) us in relation to your lifetime mortgage. 16.4 we will act reasonably when we: a) have the power to take action; b) require you to do something or not do

your lifetime mortgage will need to be transferred too. the transfer is subject to the new occupant being eligible for your lifetime mortgage and being acceptable to us. in some instances we may

valuation. 34.1 we may require further valuations of the property during your lifetime mortgage even though you have not asked for a change in your lifetime mortgage. we will be responsible for paying the cost of the valuation in this circumstance. 34.2 if you ask us to make a change to your lifetime mortgage, for example if you apply for an increase in your cash facility or if you ask for our permission, for example, to sell part of the property, and we reasonably require a valuation, then you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property takes place.

your lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. this section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. we recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event. you might also need to repay early if there is a default event, which is described in section 43 of this booklet. 35.1 you can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. the amount owed, including all of the interest, fees and costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the property, although the amount owed can be repaid from other funds. 35.2 a repayment event will occur when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. the amount owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the repayment event. you must tell us as soon as possible in writing if a repayment event occurs. 35.3 in the event of your death, your personal representative must notify us of this in writing and provide us with a death certificate and any other documentation that we reasonably require. 35.4 if you permanently leave the property for the purposes of long term care, you must provide us with written confirmation from a suitably qualified doctor or other medical or care professional who is acceptable to us. this confirmation must be in the form we reasonably require, and must confirm that you require long term care and provide details of the long term care arrangements. you should provide us with this confirmation before you leave the property so that we can confirm whether this would be an early repayment and whether an early repayment charge may be payable. 35.5 if the information provided in the written confirmation is not reasonably satisfactory to us, or is not provided before your lifetime mortgage is repaid, then payment of the amount owed will be regarded as early repayment and an early repayment charge will be payable if the payment is within the early repayment period. 35.6 following a repayment event, you (or your personal representatives in the event of your death) must, without delay, take all reasonable steps to market the property for sale and to negotiate the best possible price reasonably obtainable for the property. you must obtain our written consent to the sale.35

when the property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the sale proceeds, even if these are less than the amount owed. there is no additional charge for this guarantee. this section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply. 36.1 you must seek our written permission before you sell the property. if we reasonably believe that the anticipated sale proceeds might be less than the amount owed, including any early repayment charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified valuer to assess the property value. you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation is carried out. 36.2 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, we will accept the sale proceeds as full repayment of the amount owed. if you have breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, then the terms of section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee. 36.3 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the property. if we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the sale proceeds are not enough to cover the amount owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the sale proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the amount owed. 36.4 in the case of any proposed sale of the property, if we reasonably believe that the sale proceeds will be less than the amount owed, we may spend money on the property in order to make it more marketable. this may include paying for further valuations of the property. any amount we spend under this section will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. we will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). we will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the property is sold. if we are unable to sell the property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 if you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the property has been reduced, and/or the amount owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the sale proceeds being less than the amount owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. in this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the sale proceeds and the amount owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage agreement.36 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "840": "27 terms and conditions 36.6 if an independent valuation carried out following a repayment event

left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. if you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, and repayment of an advance happens during the early repayment period which is set out in the offer for that advance, you may have to pay a substantial early repayment charge when you repay. this is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a repayment event. if you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any early repayment charge payable at that time. you should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 37.1 if you repay all or part of the amount owed before a repayment event as explained in section 35 (which explains when a repayment event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. you can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an early repayment charge as set out in more detail below. early repayment charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in section 41. 37.2 we require at least 14 days written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we will then calculate the amount owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any early repayment charge due at that time). 37.3 you can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the amount owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period. 37.4 if the amount owed is repaid as a result of a default event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an early repayment

making a partial repayment will not increase your unused cash facility, but may reduce your cash facility. if you are making monthly payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge and section 38.7 will not apply. you should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 38.1 if there is any repayment of part of the amount owed, we may reduce your cash facility and you may have to pay an early repayment charge. 38.2 each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your initial advance offer unless the conditions set out in section 38.7 are met in respect of that partial repayment. section 38.7 does not apply if you are making monthly payments and so any partial repayment you choose to make whilst making monthly payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an early repayment charge. 38.3 we will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. this does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the property. 38.4 if there is any partial repayment it will reduce the amount owed immediately. if you have more than one advance, or costs and fees have been added to the amount owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your advances, and the costs and fees that have been added (excluding any early repayment charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 if you are making monthly payments, as detailed within section 10, then section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge if those repayments are within the early repayment period. 38.6 partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period

that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. if you have more than one advance, the amount of the partial repayment will be allocated between the advances in proportion to the amount you owe on each advance. 38.7 partial repayments will be allocated as follows: a) if the partial repayment meets the conditions in section 38.6, no early repayment charge applies. any partial repayment will be allocated between advances and any fees and costs in proportion to the advance and fees and costs when compared to the amount owed. the partial repayment will be allocated between capital and interest. this split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest). b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in section 38.6, an early repayment charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the early repayment period. this charge could be zero . if this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. if the early repayment charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.

lifetime mortgage for the full term. the early repayment charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we offer a two different early repayment charge options; variable and fixed. the type of early repayment charge must be chosen at outset. once the initial advance has completed, the type of early repayment charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the initial advance and all subsequent advances. please refer to your offer letter to understand which option applies to your lifetime mortgage. further details on the early repayment charge, including cash examples are included in your initial advance offer and each additional advance offer. the guide to our early repayment charge contains helpful information about early repayment

to the definitions section for details on when fees and costs may be applied. the early repayment charge will be applied to the total amount owed. 39.2 a maximum early repayment charge will apply to

variable early repayment charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining early repayment period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements). the way we calculate the variable early repayment charge is set out in your offer. we have set out a worked example of how the variable early repayment charge is calculated in the early repayment charge guide. fixed early repayment charge 39.5 the fixed early repayment charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid. the amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest. the early repayment charge percentage will reduce throughout the early repayment period. after the end of the early repayment period, an early repayment charge will not be payable. the fixed early repayment charge structure and a worked example is set out in your offer and our early repayment charge guide 40. benchmark interest rates (applicable to the variable early repayment charge only) the variable early repayment charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements. for this, we use the uk ftse 15 year gilt yield index. this index is published daily in the financial times (under gilts uk ftse actuaries indices, yield indices, 15 yrs). for each advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. your offer will show the benchmark interest rate and the target benchmark interest rate for the advance. 40.1 on any business day, we use the benchmark interest rate published on the previous business day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the business day before that.40 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "844": "31 terms and conditions 40.2 a target benchmark interest rate

apply. if a repayment is not made during the period a repayment statement remains valid, you must obtain another repayment statement from us. 40.4 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is less than the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is payable for that advance. an illustration of this early repayment charge is contained in your offer. 40.5 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the

other powers from section 101 of the law of property act 1925, over the property as part of your lifetime mortgage. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. 46.2 section 103 of the law of property act 1925 will not apply to your lifetime mortgage. (section 103 would otherwise restrict our powers of sale.) for example, we are not required to give you three months notice before we sell the property. 46.3 if we, or the receiver take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a mortgage lender in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. 46.4 if we, or the receiver, have to sell the property, we or the receiver may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. 46.5 if the property is sold by us, or by a receiver appointed by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. we may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us by a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. 46.6 if we, or the receiver, sell the property we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw any contract for sale. 46.7 if we, or the receiver sell the property and the sale proceeds of the property exceed the amount owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you, for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries. general conditions this section includes other general conditions that apply to your lifetime mortgage. 47. power of attorney 47.1 for the purpose of securing our interest in the property, by signing the mortgage deed you appoint us and any receiver appointed by us to be your attorney. as your attorney we (or the receiver) will be entitled to do things you are obliged to do under these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions on your behalf, and our acts will bind you as though you had done them yourself. 47.2 you cant cancel these appointments until all the money secured by the mortgage security is paid off. 4746 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "850": "37 terms and conditions 48. joint and several liability 48.1 if you have borrowed on your own you are fully responsible to pay the amount owed and to comply with your lifetime mortgage agreement. 48.2 if you have borrowed jointly then your lifetime mortgage agreement applies to both of you together and each of you separately. this means that each of you can be individually held fully responsible for complying with your lifetime mortgage agreement and paying the amount owed. 49. rights of third parties 49.1 your lifetime mortgage agreement can only be enforced by you, your successors, your personal representatives and us, our successors and any person or company to whom we transfer or assign all or part of our rights under your lifetime mortgage agreement (which includes your lifetime mortgage). 49.2 your personal representatives and successors will be bound by your lifetime mortgage agreement after your death. 50. payments 50.1 whenever you make a payment to us it should always be made during normal banking hours in sterling and come from you to us immediately. if a date for paying us falls on a non-business day then the payment should be made on the next business day. 50.2 all payments to us must be made without set-off and without any deduction on account of any tax, duty or other charge, unless a deduction is required by law. if a deduction is required by law, you will increase the payment so that we receive the amount due to us before the deduction. 51. transfer of your lifetime mortgage 51.1 we may transfer (including by declaration of trust), assign or charge all or part of our rights under your lifetime mortgage agreement (which includes your lifetime mortgage) to another person or company at any time. 51.2 if we do this the person or company who takes over the rights we transfer will have the same rights as we have. your rights and obligations will not be affected by this, and the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement will not change because of this. 51.3 we may delegate all or part of our rights and obligations under your lifetime mortgage agreement to another person or company at any time. 51.4 we may pass on details about you and your lifetime mortgage agreement to another person or company where we consider it necessary or advisable to do so in connection with any sale or financing arrangement which we may enter into or consider in connection with your lifetime mortgage. 51.5 before we legally assign your lifetime mortgage we will write to tell you. 51.6 you may not transfer, assign or charge all or part of your rights under your lifetime mortgage agreement to anyone else.48 49 50 51 call 01737 233297

of, or in connection with your lifetime mortgage can be settled in a court of law as set out below. 52.1 if the property is in england or wales, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of england and wales. 52.2 if the property is in scotland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of scotland. 52.3 if the property is in northern ireland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of northern ireland. 52.4 the terms of your lifetime mortgage agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the united kingdom in which the property is located. this means if the property is located in england or wales, the competent court will be the courts of england and wales. if the property is located in scotland, the competent court will be the scottish courts. if the property is located in northern ireland, the competent court will be the courts in northern ireland. 52.5 if any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way. 52.6 if any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement are not consistent with anything in an offer, the terms of the offer will apply. 53. changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement 53.1 we can make reasonable changes to your lifetime mortgage agreement in the following circumstances: a) to make the terms of the lifetime mortgage agreement easier to understand or fairer to you; b) to reflect an improvement of any service or facility we supply in connection with your mortgage; c) to introduce a new service; d) to replace an existing service with a new one (but only where this would not be to your disadvantage); e) to correct any obvious error that might be found in the future in relation to the written terms of the lifetime mortgage agreement.5352 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "852": "39 terms and conditions 53.2 we may also make changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement to respond proportionately to events outside of our control in the following circumstances: a) any laws and regulations we have to comply with; b) as a result of a decision by a court, ombudsman or similar body; or c) any industry guidance or code of practice we follow (where the change would not be to your disadvantage). 53.3 we will write to you at least 28 days before we have to make any changes, unless the change in the law or regulation requires us to make the change more quickly. 54. giving notice 54.1 we will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters we send will be sent to you at the property, unless you have given us another address to use. 54.2 you must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters you send must be sent to just retirement money limited at the address in the about us section, unless we have given you another address to use. 55. variations for properties in scotland due to the different legal practices, if the property is in scotland then this section will apply to you. 55.1 in section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common. if the property is in scotland, this means that the property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. in section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. in scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy. 55.2 where we refer to a legal charge, if the property is in scotland, this means a standard security under the conveyancing and feudal reform (scotland) act 1970 (the 1970 act). if we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security. 55.3 in section 8, section 22, section 23 and section 25, there are references to the property being leasehold. this is rare for a house in scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. in the unlikely event that they do, leasehold means held on a long lease and freehold means owned. forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in scotland as irritancy. in section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the property under a lease.54 55 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "853": "40 terms and conditions 55.4 a court judgement in scotland is often referred to as a decree. you will see reference to a court judgement in section 9.7. 55.5 section 15 refers to occupiers. in scotland, if the occupier is your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. this has the effect that our rights in relation to the property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have. 55.6 section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. in scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives. 55.7 section 29.3 does not apply where the property is in scotland. 55.8 if a default event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in schedule 3 to the 1970 act and we can enter into possession of the property in accordance with the 1970 act, sell the property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 act. 55.9 there is no provision in the 1970 act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in section 44.1(d), section 45, section 46 and section 47 to a receiver, do not apply. 55.10 5subject to the provisions of the 1970 act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in section 45.5, section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver. 55.11 we have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 act. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. if we take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. if we have to sell the property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. if the property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. we may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. if we sell the property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. if we sell the property and the sale proceeds of the property exceed the amount owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries. call 01737 233297 or visit

payments as described in section 10. interest is charged daily and compounded monthly (or rolled-up) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property when you die or permanently leave the property for long term care. if you repay the amount owed before this time, you may need to pay an early repayment charge. 1. your lifetime mortgage agreement 1.1 your lifetime mortgage agreement with us is

the cash facility for you to take any additional advances from is called the unused cash facility. each time you take an advance or any fees or costs are added to the amount owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow in your unused cash facility will decrease. if the arrangement fee for your initial advance is added to the amount owed, that will not affect the unused cash facility. 5.2

breach your lifetime mortgage agreement or if the economic conditions change in a material way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more money to you. this section sets out specific circumstances when you will be unable to take an additional advance even though you have not used all of your cash facility. 6.1 in some circumstances you will be unable to take additional advances. if, when you request an additional advance any of the following circumstances apply, then your unused cash facility will not be available to you: a) if the total of all the advances you have received exceeds the maximum loan amount based on your age and property value at the time the request for an additional advance is made; b) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime mortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; c) if the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time the request for an additional advance is made; d) if the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in scotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either party has died; e) if a default event occurs (default events are set out in section 43); f) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised by the fca, the fca (or any other body responsible for regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to provide the additional advance;or g) if a charge has been registered on the property (see section 29.2 for more details of this restriction). 6.2 if the event in section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow additional advances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and documentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased borrower. you will be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our costs, even if we do not agree to provide the additional advance, or the additional advance does not complete. 6.3 if you believe that our assessment of the value of the property in section 6.1(a) or section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have the right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified valuer to value the property. you will need to pay a valuation fee before the valuation of the property. in the event that this valuation confirms that we should have provided the additional advance then we will refund the valuation fee to you.6 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "869": "7 terms and conditions 7. increasing your cash facility when you have used up your cash facility, you may choose to apply to us to increase it. depending upon your circumstances, the value and condition of the property and our lending criteria at the time, we may agree to provide additional borrowing. you can apply to increase your cash facility as many times as you wish, but each time you do so you need to pay fees as referred to in this section. you will also require further financial advice from your financial adviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser. 7.1 when you have used all of your cash facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the amount of your cash facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. any increase to your cash facility will be subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement. if we agree to the increase, we will confirm the amount of your increased cash facility in an additional advance offer. 7.2 if we agree to increase your cash facility, you will be able to take an additional advance at the same

obtain a new valuation of the property from an independent, qualified valuer. if we do, you will need to pay a non- refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property. 7.6 if you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement, we might not agree to an increase in your cash facility. also, to be eligible for an increase in your cash facility, you and the property must meet our

lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and the amount owed is usually repaid from the sale of the property. additional advances and other amounts added to the amount owed will increase the amount of borrowing secured on the property. 8.1 the amount owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until you have paid us the whole of the amount owed) regardless of any repayments you make in the meantime. 8.2 we require a first legal charge over the property. when you have signed and accepted your offer and the mortgage deed, the legal charge will be registered against the title to the property at the land registry. 8.3 if the property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we may require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. 8.4 if the property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold or management company, we may require an assignment of the share or shares until you repay the amount owed and you must sign an appropriate deed for this purpose. if we sell the property, we will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser. 8.5 you must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and by carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage agreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you have with anyone else. 9. interest this section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime mortgage. interest is charged daily and rolled up monthly over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. this means that interest is charged on the interest as it rolls-up. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as the interest rolls-up. the amount of interest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in your offer. the interest rate for the initial advance is a fixed interest rate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime mortgage unless you elected to make monthly payments at the start of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these monthly payments, please refer to section 10.7). 9.1 the interest rate on your initial advance is a fixed interest rate that is shown in your initial advance offer. 9.2 the interest rate on each additional advance is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time you request the additional advance. the interest rate on the additional advance could be higher or lower than the interest rate on your initial advance. we provide an additional advance offer confirming the interest rate each time we agree to provide you with an additional advance. 98 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "871": "9 terms and conditions 9.3 the interest rate shown in an offer is only available if the advance completes before that offer expires. the date an offer expires is shown in that offer. if an offer expires and we agree to provide you with a new offer, the interest rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new offer and is shown in your new offer. 9.4 the interest rate on any fees or costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the fees or costs are added. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such fees and costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 interest is charged daily at the interest rate on each amount which forms part of the amount owed, from the date that amount is added to the amount owed, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 the interest that is charged daily forms part of the amount owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest only starts to be charged: a) for advances, from the date the relevant advance completes; or b) for any other amount (including fees and costs but excluding daily interest), from the date the relevant amount is added to the amount owed. each month, the interest that is charged daily is rolled-up, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest rolls-up. 9.7 interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the amount owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before. 9.8 a lifetime mortgage statement will be provided to you at least once a year which will show you how much interest we have charged and the amount owed. call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "872": "10terms and conditions 10. monthly payments as part of your lifetime mortgage you can agree to make monthly payments against the amount of interest charged. the amount of your ongoing monthly payment can be set between 25 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your initial advance and any additional advances. once your monthly payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a payment holiday or stop making your monthly payments altogether. if you choose to stop making monthly payments, or fail to make the monthly payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest roll- up for the remainder of your loan. once you have stopped making monthly payments they cannot be restarted. this section explains more about your options. 10.1 at the outset of your initial advance and each additional advance you can select to make monthly payments. 10.2 for the initial advance you can choose to pay between a minimum of 25.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest. 10.3 for additional advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making monthly payments on your initial advance. 10.4 the total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the advance by the interest rate and dividing by 12. 10.5 your monthly payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month. 10.6 once you have completed you cannot change the amount of your monthly payments. 10.7 you can stop making monthly payments at any time subject to giving us 1 months written notice. once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10.8 you may request one payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following completion of the initial advance, providing you give us 1 months written notice. interest not paid during a payment holiday will be added to the amount owed and interest will roll up on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage. 10.9 if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment for any month within 3 working days of the next monthly payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting monthly payments and you will not be able to re-start them. this means the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "873": "11 terms and conditions 1110.10 you cannot increase or decrease the amount of monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage once your lifetime mortgage has commenced. 10.11 if you make a partial repayment on your lifetime mortgage we may reduce the amount of your monthly payment to reflect the change in the amount owed and ensure you are not paying more than the interest due. 10.12 all monthly payments must be made in sterling. if any monthly payment falls due on a day which is not a business day, we will collect on the next business day. 11. fees that you may need to pay throughout this booklet we refer to fees that you may need to pay to us. this section tells you more about fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the fees will be. 11.1 the fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these fees are payable are described in your initial advance offer. 11.2 the fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an additional advance and when these fees are payable are described in each additional advance offer. 11.3 other fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the tariff of charges. from time to time, we may review the fees that we charge and we may add new fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect : 11.3.1 a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services; or 11.3.2 any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business. 11.4 if we change the fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new tariff of charges. 12. costs that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. you may also need to pay costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical costs that may arise. 12.1 you must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "874": "12terms and conditions 12.2 you must pay the reasonable costs that we incur during your lifetime mortgage and we will tell you at least 28 days before you need to pay us. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 12.3 where we add fees or costs to the amount owed, they will be treated in the same way as advances for the purposes of charging interest and early repayment charges, determining how much of your unused cash facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the amount owed. 13. the term of your lifetime mortgage 13.1 your offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. the term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage agreement continues to apply until the amount owed is repaid in full. 14. special conditions in some instances we may need to apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage. these special conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the property as recommended by the valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. 14.1 we may apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these special conditions are set out in your offer. special conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve the conflict. 14.2 we may ask you to satisfy special conditions before your lifetime mortgage completes. where special conditions require you to take some action in relation to the property after your lifetime mortgage completes you will have 6 months from the date of completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing. 14.3 we may require you to provide documents to confirm that a special condition in relation to the property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the property. you may need to pay a non- refundable fee for this re-inspection.1413 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "875": "13 terms and

costs. 25.8 you can ask us for details of any insurance we have put in place in respect of the property. 26. insurance claims 26.1 you must tell us as soon as possible if there is any significant loss or damage to the property. 26.2 you must take reasonable steps to make sure that nothing happens which may harm your or our ability to make a claim under the insurance. 26.3 if it is necessary to make a claim on your insurance you must tell the insurance company as soon as possible and assist the insurance company to resolve the claim. 26.4 we may also make a claim on your insurance and negotiate and settle any claims on your behalf. 26.5 the claims money must be used to make good any loss or damage it has been paid for, or if we agree with you, it will be used to reduce or repay the amount owed. if there has been significant loss or damage to the property, we may ask you to instruct your insurance company to pay all claims money to us, but if you receive the claims money, you will hold it on trust for us. 27. maintaining the property you will continue to be responsible for the on-going maintenance of the property. we will be reasonable and not expect you to maintain the property to a standard that exceeds the condition at the time we valued the property, unless your offer was subject to special conditions requiring repairs or other work to be carried out. 27.1 during your

maintained then we may ask you to carry out the repairs at your own expense. if the repairs are not made, we may arrange for the repairs to be carried out on your behalf and you will need to pay any costs that we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. if, in our reasonable opinion, we decide that the property is not being maintained in accordance with this section 27 and you fail to carry out the repairs required under this section 27.5, this will be a serious breach of your lifetime mortgage. 28. making changes to the property you must tell us if you wish to alter the property. we will not unreasonably prevent you from making changes to the property, but we have put in place safeguards. these safeguards are to ensure that any changes you intend to make do not adversely affect the value of the property, meet all the relevant laws and are carried out to an acceptable standard. 28.1 you must not alter the property structurally, extend or convert the property or change the use of the property unless you have our written permission to do so. you will be responsible for paying for the cost

to pay a non-refundable fee for this. 29. other secured borrowing your lifetime mortgage is secured on the property and you will need our written permission if you want to take secured borrowing from another lender or create any other charge on the property. other lenders may not be willing to lend to you because we have a first charge on the property and the amount owed will increase due to the roll-up of interest.2928 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "883": "21 terms and conditions 29.1 you must ask for our written permission if you want another mortgage or loan from another

exercise any of the powers given to us by your lifetime mortgage agreement or under the law. this includes you signing any appropriate documents or deeds relating to the property. 30.2 you must ensure that any information you give us is accurate and you do not withhold information from us that we would reasonably expect to be given under your lifetime mortgage agreement. 30.3 you must provide any

possession of the property or that we have accepted the legal responsibilities as if we had possessed the property. what if your circumstances change? this part covers what you need to know if your circumstances change. if a change in your circumstances makes it necessary to alter your lifetime mortgage then you will need to pay any fees and costs due to us, plus any legal fees, expenses and

your lifetime mortgage will need to be transferred too. the transfer is subject to the new occupant being eligible for your lifetime mortgage and being acceptable to us. in some instances we may reduce your cash facility and you may have to repay part of the amount owed. this is because the amount you are entitled to borrow from us depends on the age of the borrowers and other factors. 33.1 after your lifetime mortgage has completed, you must tell us if you want someone else to move into the property to live with you, for example a family member, a new partner or a carer. occupiers will not have the right to live in the property after your death or when you permanently leave the property. 33.2 we may require the new occupier to sign an occupier consent form, with the help of an

your lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. this section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. we recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event. you might also need to repay early if there is a default event, which is described in section 43 of this booklet. 35.1 you can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. the amount owed, including all of the interest, fees and costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the property, although the amount owed can be repaid from other funds. 35.2 a repayment event will occur when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. the amount owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the repayment event. you must tell us as soon as possible in writing if a repayment event occurs. 35.3 in the event of your death, your personal representative must notify us of this in writing and provide us with a death certificate and any other documentation that we reasonably require. 35.4 if you permanently leave the property for the purposes of long term care, you must provide us with written confirmation from a suitably qualified doctor or other medical or care professional who is acceptable to us. this confirmation must be in the form we reasonably require, and must confirm that you require long term care and provide details of the long term care arrangements. you should provide us with this confirmation before you leave the property so that we can confirm whether this would be an early repayment and whether an early repayment charge may be payable. 35.5 if the information provided in the written confirmation is not reasonably satisfactory to us, or is not provided before your lifetime mortgage is repaid, then payment of the amount owed will be regarded as early repayment and an early repayment charge will be payable if the payment is within the early repayment period. 35.6 following a repayment event, you (or your personal representatives in the event of your death) must, without delay, take all reasonable steps to market the property for sale and to negotiate the best possible price reasonably obtainable for the property. you must obtain our written consent to the sale.35

when the property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the sale proceeds, even if these are less than the amount owed. there is no additional charge for this guarantee. this section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply. 36.1 you must seek our written permission before you sell the property. if we reasonably believe that the anticipated sale proceeds might be less than the amount owed, including any early repayment charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified valuer to assess the property value. you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation is carried out. 36.2 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, we will accept the sale proceeds as full repayment of the amount owed. if you have breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, then the terms of section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee. 36.3 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the property. if we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the sale proceeds are not enough to cover the amount owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the sale proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the amount owed. 36.4 in the case of any proposed sale of the property, if we reasonably believe that the sale proceeds will be less than the amount owed, we may spend money on the property in order to make it more marketable. this may include paying for further valuations of the property. any amount we spend under this section will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. we will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). we will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the property is sold. if we are unable to sell the property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 if you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the property has been reduced, and/or the amount owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the sale proceeds being less than the amount owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. in this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the sale proceeds and the amount owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage agreement.36 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "889": "27 terms and conditions 36.6 if an independent valuation carried out following a repayment event

repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any early repayment charge payable at that time. you should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 37.1 if you repay all or part of the amount owed before a repayment event as explained in section 35 (which explains when a repayment event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. you can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an early repayment charge as set out in more detail below. early repayment charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in section 41. 37.2 we require at least 14 days written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we will then calculate the amount owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any early repayment charge due at that time). 37.3 you can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the amount owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period. 37.4 if the amount owed is repaid as a result of a default event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an early repayment

making a partial repayment will not increase your unused cash facility, but may reduce your cash facility. if you are making monthly payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments

from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 38.1 if there is any repayment of part of the amount owed, we may reduce your cash facility and you may have to pay an early repayment charge. 38.2 each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your initial advance offer unless the conditions set out in section 38.7 are met in respect of that partial repayment. section 38.7 does not apply if you are making monthly payments and so any partial repayment you choose to make whilst making monthly payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an early repayment charge. 38.3 we will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. this does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the property. 38.4 if there is any partial repayment it will reduce the amount owed immediately. if you have more than one advance, or costs and fees have been added to the amount owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your advances, and the costs and fees that have been added (excluding any early repayment charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 if you are making monthly payments, as detailed within section 10, then section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to

that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. if you have more than one advance, the amount of the partial repayment will be allocated between the advances in proportion to the amount you owe on each advance. 38.7 partial repayments will be allocated as follows: a) if the partial repayment meets the conditions in section 38.6, no early repayment charge applies. any partial repayment will be allocated between advances and any fees and costs in proportion to the advance and fees and costs when compared to the amount owed. the partial repayment will be allocated between capital and interest. this split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest). b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in section 38.6, an early repayment charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the early repayment period. this charge could be zero . if this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. if the early repayment charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above.

benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements). the way we calculate the variable early repayment charge is set out in your offer. we have set out a worked example of how the variable early repayment charge is calculated in the early repayment charge guide. fixed early repayment charge 39.5 the fixed early repayment charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid. the amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest. the early repayment charge percentage will reduce throughout the early repayment period. after the end of the early repayment period, an early repayment charge will not be payable. the fixed early repayment charge structure and a worked example is set out in your offer and our early repayment charge guide 40. benchmark interest rates (applicable to the variable early repayment charge only) the variable early repayment charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements. for this, we use the uk ftse 15 year gilt yield index. this index is published daily in the financial times (under gilts uk ftse actuaries indices, yield indices, 15 yrs). for each advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. your offer will show the benchmark interest rate and the target benchmark interest rate for the advance. 40.1 on any business day, we use the benchmark interest rate published on the previous business day and that is itself

apply. if a repayment is not made during the period a repayment statement remains valid, you must obtain another repayment statement from us. 40.4 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is less than the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid,

take you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the property or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender. 42.3 if you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then we reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect our rights and the value of the property and the security for your lifetime mortgage. for example, this may require us to enter the property and carry out repairs. 42.4 if we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any costs that we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. 42.5 where we have to take action or incur costs because you have not complied with your lifetime mortgage agreement and so you are in breach, our action or incurring of costs does not stop you being in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement (whether or not we add costs to the amount owed because you have not paid them). 42.6 if you breach your lifetime mortgage agreement, this can affect the no negative equity guarantee. please see section 36.5.42 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "895": "33 terms and conditions 43. what is a

proceedings. if you do not pay these when we ask you to, then these amounts will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. 45. appointment of a property receiver where a default event occurs we can appoint a receiver for all or part of the property. the receiver will act as your agent and this means you are responsible for their costs and their actions. we, or the receiver, can do anything that you could do with the property, such as signing documents to do with your lifetime mortgage agreement or the property. if your property is in scotland, we have rights under the standard security but these do not include appointing a receiver. we are entitled to exercise our rights and remedies ourselves. please see section 55.9. 45.1 if a default event occurs, or if the property or our security appears to be at risk (for example, another creditor takes enforcement action in respect of the property), then we have the right to appoint a receiver. we can do this without giving you any prior notice. we can also remove the receiver and choose whether or not we need to appoint another one. 45.2 none of the restrictions made by the law of property act 1925 in relation to the

other powers from section 101 of the law of property act 1925, over the property as part of your lifetime mortgage. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. 46.2 section 103 of the law of property act 1925 will not apply to your lifetime mortgage.

relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a mortgage lender in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the

of, or in connection with your lifetime mortgage can be settled in a court of law as set out below. 52.1 if the property is in england or wales, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of england and wales. 52.2 if the property is in scotland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of scotland. 52.3 if the property is in northern ireland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of northern ireland. 52.4 the terms of your lifetime mortgage agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the united kingdom in which the property is located. this means if the property is located in england or wales, the competent court will be the courts of england and wales. if the property is located in scotland, the competent court will be the scottish courts. if the property is located in northern ireland, the competent court will be the courts in northern ireland. 52.5 if any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way. 52.6 if any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement are not consistent with anything in an offer, the terms of the offer will apply. 53. changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement 53.1 we can make reasonable changes to your lifetime mortgage agreement in the following circumstances: a) to make the terms of the lifetime mortgage agreement easier to understand or fairer to you; b) to reflect an improvement of any service or facility we supply in connection with your mortgage; c) to introduce a new service; d) to replace an existing service with a new one (but only where this would not be to your disadvantage); e) to correct any obvious error that might be found in the future in relation to the written terms of the lifetime mortgage agreement.5352 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "901": "39 terms and conditions 53.2 we may also make changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement to respond proportionately to events outside of our control in the following circumstances: a) any laws and regulations we have to comply with; b) as a result of a decision by a court, ombudsman or similar body; or c) any industry guidance or code of practice we follow (where the change would not be to your disadvantage). 53.3 we will write to you at least 28 days before we have to make any changes, unless the change in the law or regulation requires us to make the change more quickly. 54. giving notice 54.1 we will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters we send will be sent to you at the property, unless you have given us another address to use. 54.2 you must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters you send must be sent to just retirement money limited at the address in the about us section, unless we have given you another address to use. 55. variations for properties in scotland due to the different legal practices, if the property is in scotland then this section will apply to you. 55.1 in section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common. if the property is in scotland, this means that the property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. in section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. in scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy. 55.2 where we refer to a legal charge, if the property is in scotland, this means a standard security under the conveyancing and feudal reform (scotland) act 1970 (the 1970 act). if we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security. 55.3 in section 8, section 22, section 23 and section 25, there are references to the property being leasehold. this is rare for a house in scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. in the unlikely event that they do, leasehold means held on a long lease and freehold means owned. forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in scotland as irritancy. in section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the property under a lease.54 55 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "902": "40 terms and conditions 55.4 a court judgement in scotland is often referred to as a decree. you will see reference to a court judgement in section 9.7. 55.5 section 15 refers to occupiers. in scotland, if the occupier is your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. this has the effect that our rights in relation to the property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have. 55.6 section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. in scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives. 55.7 section 29.3 does not apply where the property is in scotland. 55.8 if a default event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in schedule 3 to the 1970 act and we can enter into possession of the property in accordance with the 1970 act, sell the property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 act. 55.9 there is no provision in the 1970 act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in section 44.1(d), section 45, section 46 and section 47 to a receiver, do not apply. 55.10 5subject to the provisions of the 1970 act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in section 45.5, section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver. 55.11 we have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 act. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. if we take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. if we have to sell the property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. if the property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. we may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. if we sell the property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. if we sell the property and the sale proceeds of the property exceed the amount owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries. call 01737 233297 or visit

agree to provide you with a new offer, the interest rate is a fixed interest rate that we agree at the time we issue you with the new offer and is shown in your new offer. 9.4 the interest rate on any fees or costs added to your lifetime mortgage will be a fixed interest rate that is set by us at the time the fees or costs are added. you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such fees and costs at the time they are added. the interest rates applying to all fees and costs will be summarised in your annual statement. 9.5 interest is charged daily at the interest rate on each amount which forms part of the amount owed, from the date that amount is added to the amount owed, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full or, if repaid in full before the end of the notice period detailed in section 37.2, until the end of that notice period. 9.6 the interest that is charged daily forms part of the amount owed for the purposes of working out what you must repay, but interest

amount is added to the amount owed. each month, the interest that is charged daily is rolled-up, with interest being charged on that interest from that month onward. the amount of interest charged therefore increases as interest rolls-up. 9.7 interest will continue to be charged on each amount forming part of the amount owed at the same fixed interest rate after a court judgment as before. 9.8

payment can be set between 25 to 100% of the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to completion of your initial advance and any additional advances. once your monthly payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, however you will have the ability to take a payment holiday or stop making your monthly payments altogether. if you choose to stop making monthly payments, or fail to make the monthly payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime of your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest roll- up for the remainder of your loan. once you have stopped making monthly payments they cannot be restarted. this section explains more about your options. 10.1 at the outset of your initial advance and each additional advance you can select to make monthly payments. 10.2 for the initial advance you can choose to pay between a minimum of 25.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest. 10.3 for additional advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making monthly payments on your initial advance. 10.4 the total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the advance by the interest rate and dividing by 12. 10.5 your monthly payment will be collected by direct debit from your designated bank account on the agreed collection date of either the 1st or 15th of each month. 10.6 once you have completed you cannot change the amount of your monthly payments. 10.7 you can stop making monthly payments at any time subject to giving us 1 months written notice. once you fail to make 6 monthly payments you cannot restart them. the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10.8 you may request one payment holiday of up to 3 consecutive months in each 12 month period following completion of the initial advance, providing you give us 1 months written notice. interest not paid during a payment holiday will be added to the amount owed and interest will roll up on this for the remaining term of your lifetime mortgage. 10.9 if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment for any month within 3 working days of the next monthly payment due date then the payment will be classed as missed. if you fail to make the agreed monthly payment on 6 occasions over the duration of your lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting monthly payments and you will not be able to re-start them. this means the interest rate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your offer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis for the remaining term. 10 call 01737 233297 or visit

you make a partial repayment on your lifetime mortgage we may reduce the amount of your monthly payment to reflect the change in the amount owed and ensure you are not paying more than the interest due. 10.12 all monthly payments must be made in sterling. if any monthly payment falls due on a day which is not a business day, we will collect on the next business day. 11. fees that you may need to pay throughout this booklet we refer to fees that you may need to pay to us. this section tells you more about fees, including when we can change them and where you can find out how much the fees will be. 11.1 the fees that you need to pay to us so that we can arrange your lifetime mortgage and when these fees are payable are described in your initial advance offer. 11.2 the fees that you need to pay to us so that you can take an additional advance and when these fees are payable are described in each additional advance offer. 11.3 other fees that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage are described in the tariff of charges. from time to time, we may review the fees that we charge and we may add new fees and/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect : 11.3.1 a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services; or 11.3.2 any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take account of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar body) or any industry guidance or code of practice we follow. any increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our reasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change on the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business. 11.4 if we change the fees that we charge, we will provide you with a new tariff of charges. 12. costs that you may need to pay during your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees and expenses to others. you may also need to pay costs to us and this section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. throughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical costs that may arise. 12.1 you must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are payable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal adviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime mortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we and you have specifically agreed otherwise.12 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "949":

will be summarised in your annual statement. 12.3 where we add fees or costs to the amount owed, they will be treated in the same way as advances for the purposes of charging interest and early repayment charges, determining how much of your unused cash facility (where applicable) is left, and how partial repayments are applied to the amount owed. 13. the term of your lifetime mortgage 13.1 your offer provides you with an illustration of the cost of your lifetime mortgage based on an estimated term. the term of your lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than the estimated term. your lifetime mortgage continues to run and your lifetime mortgage agreement continues to apply until the amount owed is repaid in full. 14. special conditions in some instances we may need to apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage. these special conditions may require you to do something, for example carry out essential repairs to the property as recommended by the valuer or may vary the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. 14.1 we may apply special conditions to your lifetime mortgage and these special conditions are set out in your offer. special conditions which conflict with anything in your lifetime mortgage agreement will apply instead, to the extent needed to resolve the conflict. 14.2 we may ask you to satisfy special conditions before your lifetime mortgage completes. where special conditions require you to take some action in relation to the property after your lifetime mortgage completes you will have 6 months from the date of completion to satisfy the conditions unless another period of time has been agreed by us and notified to you in writing. 14.3 we may require you to provide documents to confirm that a special condition in relation to the property has been satisfied and/or we may decide to re-inspect the property. you may need to pay a non- refundable fee for this re-inspection.1413 call 01737 233297 or

remain living in the property. 32.3 you will have to pay fees to us, which might include an arrangement fee. the interest rate applicable at the time of the transfer will continue to apply after the transfer other than in relation to the arrangement fee. if you add this to the amount owed you will be notified of the interest rate applicable to such arrangement fee at the time it is added. the interest rate applying to your arrangement fee will be summarised in your annual statement. 32.4 you will also be responsible for paying all of the legal expenses and costs, including our costs, even

right to continue to live in the property when you die or permanently leave the property. if you are borrowing on your own and you wish to transfer the property into joint ownership, then your lifetime mortgage will need to be transferred too. the transfer is subject to the new occupant being eligible for your lifetime mortgage and being acceptable to us. in some instances we may reduce your cash facility and you may have to repay part of the amount owed. this is because the amount you are entitled to borrow from us depends on the age of the borrowers and other factors. 33.1 after your lifetime mortgage has completed, you must tell us if you want someone else to move into the property to live with you, for example a family member, a new partner or a carer. occupiers will not have the right to live in the property after your death or when you permanently leave the property. 33.2 we may require the new occupier to sign an occupier consent form, with the help of an

transfer does not complete. 33.6 to add a new borrower, we may obtain a valuation of the property by an independent, qualified valuer. you will need to pay a non- refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property. 33.7 if we are not reasonably satisfied that the property provides adequate security for the new arrangement, we may reduce your cash facility and we may ask you to repay part of the amount owed. in this instance, you may have to pay an early repayment charge. 33.8 our agreement to add another person as a joint borrower will be subject to you and the new borrower signing such documentation, for example a new mortgage deed, and taking such steps as we require. 33.9 if we do not give our permission for you to transfer the property into joint ownership but you

decide to revalue the property, or you may ask us to revalue the property, for example if you apply for an increase in your cash facility. this section describes this process and who pays for the valuation. 34.1 we may require further valuations of the property during your lifetime mortgage even though you have not asked for a change in your lifetime mortgage. we will be responsible for paying the cost of the valuation in this circumstance. 34.2 if you ask us to make a change to your lifetime mortgage, for example if you apply for an increase in your cash facility or if you ask for our permission, for example, to sell part of the property, and we reasonably require a valuation, then you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation of the property takes place.

your lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. this section describes the process that you and/or your personal representatives will need to follow. we recommend you discuss this with your personal representatives and/or your beneficiaries before the event. you might also need to repay early if there is a default event, which is described in section 43 of this booklet. 35.1 you can agree to make monthly payments on your lifetime mortgage but you do not have to make any repayments for the duration of your lifetime mortgage if you decide not to. the amount owed, including all of the interest, fees and costs due to us will usually be repaid from the sale of the property, although the amount owed can be repaid from other funds. 35.2 a repayment event will occur when you die or have permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has either died or permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. the amount owed must be repaid within 12 months from the date of the repayment event. you must tell us as soon as possible in writing if a repayment event occurs. 35.3 in the event of your death, your personal representative must notify us of this in writing and provide us with a death certificate and any other documentation that we reasonably require. 35.4 if you permanently leave the property for the purposes of long term care, you must provide us with written confirmation from a suitably qualified doctor or other medical or care professional who is acceptable to us. this confirmation must be in the form we reasonably require, and must confirm that you require long term care and provide details of the long term care arrangements. you should provide us with this confirmation before you leave the property so that we can confirm whether this would be an early repayment and whether an early repayment charge may be payable. 35.5 if the information provided in the written confirmation is not reasonably satisfactory to us, or is not provided before your lifetime mortgage is repaid, then payment of the amount owed will be regarded as early repayment and an early repayment charge will be payable if the payment is within the early repayment period. 35.6 following a repayment event, you (or your personal representatives in the event of your death) must, without delay, take all reasonable steps to market the property for sale and to negotiate the best possible price reasonably obtainable for the property. you must obtain our written consent to the sale.35

when the property is sold for a fair market price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime mortgage agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay more than the sale proceeds, even if these are less than the amount owed. there is no additional charge for this guarantee. this section explains how this guarantee works and when it will apply. 36.1 you must seek our written permission before you sell the property. if we reasonably believe that the anticipated sale proceeds might be less than the amount owed, including any early repayment charge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified valuer to assess the property value. you will need to pay a non-refundable valuation fee before the valuation is carried out. 36.2 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, we will accept the sale proceeds as full repayment of the amount owed. if you have breached your lifetime mortgage agreement, then the terms of section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no negative equity guarantee. 36.3 if the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated sale proceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to consent to the sale of the property. if we do consent to the sale at less than a fair market price, and the sale proceeds are not enough to cover the amount owed then the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of money between the sale proceeds and the lower of the fair market price as confirmed by the independent valuation and the amount owed. 36.4 in the case of any proposed sale of the property, if we reasonably believe that the sale proceeds will be less than the amount owed, we may spend money on the property in order to make it more marketable. this may include paying for further valuations of the property. any amount we spend under this section will be added to the amount owed and interest will be charged. we will only exercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, where the house is in a poor state of repair). we will not spend more than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably expect to be recovered when the property is sold. if we are unable to sell the property for fair market value, we reserve the right to rent the property until such time as a value can be achieved. 36.5 if you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage agreement and as a result of that breach the value of the property has been reduced, and/or the amount owed has increased, and that breach results in or contributes to the sale proceeds being less than the amount owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not apply in full. in this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall between the sale proceeds and the amount owed to the extent we reasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your breach of the lifetime mortgage agreement.36 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "964": "27 terms and conditions 36.6 if an independent valuation carried out following a repayment event

left the property for the purposes of long term care or, if you are borrowing jointly, each of you has died or has permanently left the property for the purposes of long term care. if you repay your lifetime mortgage at any time before that, for any other reason, and repayment of an advance happens during the early repayment period which is set out in the offer for that advance, you may have to pay a substantial early repayment charge when you repay. this is to protect us against the financial consequences of you repaying your lifetime mortgage before a repayment event. if you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early, we will provide you with a repayment statement which will include the amount of any early repayment charge payable at that time. you should think carefully before you decide to repay your lifetime mortgage early and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 37.1 if you repay all or part of the amount owed before a repayment event as explained in section 35 (which explains when a repayment event occurs), then this will be treated as an early repayment. you can repay your lifetime mortgage early, at any time, but you may have to pay an early repayment charge as set out in more detail below. early repayment charges do not apply in certain circumstances which are explained in more detail in section 41. 37.2 we require at least 14 days written notice before the date your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we will then calculate the amount owed to us at the end of the 14 day notice period and send you a repayment statement (which will set out any early repayment charge due at that time). 37.3 you can repay before the end of the 14 day notice period, but if you do, you will need to repay the amount owed to us as calculated as at the end of the 14 day notice period. 37.4 if the amount owed is repaid as a result of a default event, then we will regard this as early repayment and an early repayment charge may be payable.37 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "965": "28terms and conditions 38. partial repayment you are able to repay part of your lifetime mortgage at any time, subject to

making a partial repayment will not increase your unused cash facility, but may reduce your cash facility. if you are making monthly payments then you are not able to make partial early repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge and section 38.7 will not apply. you should think carefully before you decide to make a partial repayment and if necessary you should seek advice from your financial adviser and/or legal adviser. 38.1 if there is any repayment of part of the amount owed, we may reduce your cash facility and you may have to pay an early repayment charge. 38.2 each partial repayment you choose to make is subject to a minimum payment as shown in your initial advance offer unless the conditions set out in section 38.7 are met in respect of that partial repayment. section 38.7 does not apply if you are making monthly payments and so any partial repayment you choose to make whilst making monthly payments will be subject to a minimum payment and may be subject to an early repayment charge. 38.3 we will not accept a partial repayment if the partial repayment reduces the amount owed to a value that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. this does not apply where a partial repayment is required by us as a result of a change in your circumstances, including for example moving home or someone else moving into the property. 38.4 if there is any partial repayment it will reduce the amount owed immediately. if you have more than one advance, or costs and fees have been added to the amount owed, then the amount repaid will be applied in proportion to the amount you owe on each of your advances, and the costs and fees that have been added (excluding any early repayment charge payable when the partial repayment is made). 38.5 if you are making monthly payments, as detailed within section 10, then section 38.6 does not apply and you are not able to make partial repayments without being subject to an early repayment charge if those repayments are within the early repayment period. 38.6 partial repayments will be accepted in each 12 month period

that is less than (excluding any early repayment charge payable) the minimum initial advance as set out in your initial advance offer. if you have more than one advance, the amount of the partial repayment will be allocated between the advances in proportion to the amount you owe on each advance. 38.7 partial repayments will be allocated as follows: a) if the partial repayment meets the conditions in section 38.6, no early repayment charge applies. any partial repayment will be allocated between advances and any fees and costs in proportion to the advance and fees and costs when compared to the amount owed. the partial repayment will be allocated between capital and interest. this split is allocated proportionately based on the size of the original capital and the size of the outstanding amount due at the time (i.e. capital plus interest). b) if the partial repayment does not meet the conditions in section 38.6, an early repayment charge will be calculated on the partial repayment if it is paid within the early repayment period. this charge could be zero . if this is zero, the partial repayment will be calculated as described above. if the early repayment charge is more than zero, it will be deducted from the partial repayment, before the remainder of the partial repayment is allocated to the account between capital and interest in the same way described above. 39. early repayment charges if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an early repayment charge. this is to protect us against the financial consequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full term. the early repayment charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we offer a two different early repayment charge options; variable and fixed. the type of early repayment charge must be chosen at outset. once the initial advance has completed, the type of early repayment charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the initial advance and all subsequent advances. please refer to your offer letter to understand which option applies to your lifetime mortgage. further details on the early repayment charge, including cash examples are included in your initial advance offer and each additional advance offer. the guide to our early repayment charge contains helpful information about early repayment charges.39 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "967": "30terms and conditions 39.1 the early repayment charge is charged against each advance you receive from your cash facility to protect us

to the definitions section for details on when fees and costs may be applied. the early repayment charge will be applied to the total amount owed. 39.2 a maximum early repayment charge will apply to your initial advance and will be shown in your initial advance offer a maximum early repayment charge will also apply to each additional advance and will be shown in each additional advance offer 39.3 if you request to repay early, we will send you a repayment statement providing you with the amount of your early repayment charge payable at that time. variable early repayment charge 39.4 the variable early repayment charge is calculated by us taking into account the amount you repay, the remaining early repayment period and any movement in the level of long term interest rates (we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements). the way we calculate the variable early repayment charge is set out in your offer. we have set out a worked example of how the variable early repayment charge is calculated in the early repayment charge guide. fixed early repayment charge 39.5 the fixed early repayment charge is calculated as a percentage of the amount repaid. the amount to be repaid includes the advance, plus any fees added to the loan, plus interest. the early repayment charge percentage will reduce throughout the early repayment period. after the end of the early repayment period, an early repayment charge will not be payable. the fixed early repayment charge structure and a worked example is set out in your offer and our early repayment charge guide 40. benchmark interest rates (applicable to the variable early repayment charge only) the variable early repayment charge is linked to the movement of long term interest rates, and we use benchmark interest rates to take account of these movements. for this, we use the uk ftse 15 year gilt yield index. this index is published daily in the financial times (under gilts uk ftse actuaries indices, yield indices, 15 yrs). for each advance, we measure the change in long term interest rates from when the offer is issued to you to when we issue your repayment statement. your offer will show the benchmark interest rate and the target benchmark interest rate for the advance. 40.1 on any business day, we use the benchmark interest rate published on the previous business day and that is itself based on the position applying at the close of the business day before that.40 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "968": "31 terms and conditions 40.2 a target benchmark interest rate

apply. if a repayment is not made during the period a repayment statement remains valid, you must obtain another repayment statement from us. 40.4 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is less than the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is payable for that advance. an illustration of this early repayment charge is contained in your offer. 40.5 for each advance, if the benchmark interest rate provided in the repayment statement is the same as, or more than, the target benchmark interest rate shown in your offer for that advance and repayment is made during the period this repayment statement remains valid, an early repayment charge is not payable for that advance. 40.6 your offer provides a table of early repayment charge cash examples for particular movements in the benchmark interest rate and

power of sale if a default event occurs. 46.2 section 103 of the law of property act 1925 will not apply to your lifetime mortgage. (section 103 would otherwise restrict our powers of sale.) for example, we are not required to give you three months notice before we sell the property. 46.3 if we, or the receiver take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a mortgage lender in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. 46.4 if we, or the receiver, have to sell the property, we or the receiver may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. 46.5 if the property is sold by us, or by a receiver appointed by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. we may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us by a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. 46.6 if we, or the receiver, sell the property we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw any contract for sale. 46.7 if we, or the receiver sell the property and the sale proceeds of the property exceed the amount owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you, for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries. general conditions this section includes other general conditions that apply to your lifetime mortgage. 47. power of attorney 47.1 for the purpose of securing our interest in the property, by signing the mortgage deed you appoint us and any receiver appointed by us to be your attorney. as your attorney we (or the receiver) will be entitled to do things you are obliged to do under these lifetime mortgage terms and conditions on your behalf, and our acts will bind you as though you had done them yourself. 47.2 you cant cancel these appointments until all the money secured by the mortgage security is paid off. 4746 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "974": "37 terms and conditions 48. joint and several liability 48.1 if you have borrowed on your own you are fully responsible to pay the amount owed and to comply with your lifetime mortgage agreement. 48.2 if you have borrowed jointly then your lifetime mortgage agreement applies to both of you together and each of you separately. this means that each of you can be individually held fully responsible for complying with your lifetime mortgage agreement and paying the amount owed. 49. rights of third parties 49.1 your lifetime mortgage agreement can only be enforced by you, your successors, your personal representatives and us, our successors and any person or company to whom we transfer or assign all or part of our rights under your lifetime mortgage agreement (which includes your lifetime mortgage). 49.2 your personal representatives and successors will be bound by your lifetime mortgage agreement after your death. 50. payments 50.1 whenever you make a payment to us it should always be made during normal banking hours in sterling and come from you to us immediately. if a date for paying us falls on a non-business day then the payment should be made on the next business day. 50.2 all payments to us must be made without set-off and without any deduction on account of any tax, duty or other charge, unless a deduction is required by law. if a deduction is required by law, you will increase the payment so that we receive the amount due to us before the deduction. 51. transfer of your lifetime mortgage 51.1 we may transfer (including by declaration of trust), assign or charge all or part of our rights under your lifetime mortgage agreement (which includes your lifetime mortgage) to another person or company at any time. 51.2 if we do this the person or company who takes over the rights we transfer will have the same rights as we have. your rights and obligations will not be affected by this, and the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement will not change because of this. 51.3 we may delegate all or part of our rights and obligations under your lifetime mortgage agreement to another person or company at any time. 51.4 we may pass on details about you and your lifetime mortgage agreement to another person or company where we consider it necessary or advisable to do so in connection with any sale or financing arrangement which we may enter into or consider in connection with your lifetime mortgage. 51.5 before we legally assign your

of, or in connection with your lifetime mortgage can be settled in a court of law as set out below. 52.1 if the property is in england or wales, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of england and wales. 52.2 if the property is in scotland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of scotland. 52.3 if the property is in northern ireland, your lifetime mortgage agreement is governed by the laws of northern ireland. 52.4 the terms of your lifetime mortgage agreement are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the country within the united kingdom in which the property is located. this means if the property is located in england or wales, the competent court will be the courts of england and wales. if the property is located in scotland, the competent court will be the scottish courts. if the property is located in northern ireland, the competent court will be the courts in northern ireland. 52.5 if any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and conditions will not be affected in any way. 52.6 if any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement are not consistent with anything in an offer, the terms of the offer will apply. 53. changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement 53.1 we can make reasonable changes to your lifetime mortgage agreement in the following circumstances: a) to make the terms of the lifetime mortgage agreement easier to understand or fairer to you; b) to reflect an improvement of any service or facility we supply in connection with your mortgage; c) to introduce a new service; d) to replace an existing service with a new one (but only where this would not be to your disadvantage); e) to correct any obvious error that might be found in the future in relation to the written terms of the lifetime mortgage agreement.5352 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "976": "39 terms and conditions 53.2 we may also make changes to the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement to respond proportionately to events outside of our control in the following circumstances: a) any laws and regulations we have to comply with; b) as a result of a decision by a court, ombudsman or similar body; or c) any industry guidance or code of practice we follow (where the change would not be to your disadvantage). 53.3 we will write to you at least 28 days before we have to make any changes, unless the change in the law or regulation requires us to make the change more quickly. 54. giving notice 54.1 we will write to you to give you any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters we send will be sent to you at the property, unless you have given us another address to use. 54.2 you must also write to us to give us any notices needed under the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage agreement. any letters you send must be sent to just retirement money limited at the address in the about us section, unless we have given you another address to use. 55. variations for properties in scotland due to the different legal practices, if the property is in scotland then this section will apply to you. 55.1 in section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common. if the property is in scotland, this means that the property is in joint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and so each of you is able to dispose of your share of the property as you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically transferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. in section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants in common. in scotland, owners would not usually be referred to as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership rather than tenancy. 55.2 where we refer to a legal charge, if the property is in scotland, this means a standard security under the conveyancing and feudal reform (scotland) act 1970 (the 1970 act). if we refer to a first legal charge, we mean a first standard security. 55.3 in section 8, section 22, section 23 and section 25, there are references to the property being leasehold. this is rare for a house in scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that mention leaseholds will apply to you. in the unlikely event that they do, leasehold means held on a long lease and freehold means owned. forfeiture means that the lease is terminated by the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to in scotland as irritancy. in section 24, there is reference to payment of rent which would only apply if you held the property under a lease.54 55 call 01737 233297 or visit wearejust.co.uk", "977": "40 terms and conditions 55.4 a court judgement in scotland is often referred to as a decree. you will see reference to a court judgement in section 9.7. 55.5 section 15 refers to occupiers. in scotland, if the occupier is your spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the property, he or she will be required to sign the standard security, with the help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your granting it. this has the effect that our rights in relation to the property take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she may otherwise have. 55.6 section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. in scotland, the equivalent is conclusion of missives. 55.7 section 29.3 does not apply where the property is in scotland. 55.8 if a default event occurs, you will be held to be in default within the meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions set out in schedule 3 to the 1970 act and we can enter into possession of the property in accordance with the 1970 act, sell the property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 act and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the 1970 act. 55.9 there is no provision in the 1970 act for the appointment of a property receiver and so references in section 44.1(d), section 45, section 46 and section 47 to a receiver, do not apply. 55.10 5subject to the provisions of the 1970 act, we may decide to do all or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can decide to do in section 45.5, section 45.6 will apply to costs that we incur in doing any of these things and section 45.8 will apply, apart from the reference to a receiver. 55.11 we have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 act. for example, we will have the power to insure the property. we may exercise the power of sale if a default event occurs. if we take some action in relation to the property but have not taken possession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. this means that you will still be responsible for the property, for example, insuring the property. if we have to sell the property, we may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. we may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. you will need to pay any costs we incur. if you fail to pay those costs when we ask, we will add them to the amount owed, and interest will apply to those costs. if the property is sold by us, it can be sold as a whole or in parts. we may sell by auction or by private sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, in instalments or a partial payment. if we sell the property, we can make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or even withdraw from any contract for sale. if we sell the property and the sale proceeds of the property exceed the amount owed, assuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over will be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries. call 01737 233297 or visit

compounds monthly and is fixed and will not change for the duration of the lifetime mortgage, unless your client originally chooses to pay some or all of the monthly interest amount and stops prior to repayment of their lifetime mortgage. the interest rate for the initial advance is shown in the offer document. the rate is guaranteed for six weeks from the date of issue of the offer. if the advance isnt completed within six weeks, the offer will expire. any replacement offer will be in line with the terms available at the time, so the interest rate may change. interest is charged on a monthly

line with the terms available at the time, so once again the interest rate may change. please note, in section 8 of the key facts illustration (kfi) we take into account calendar years rather than compounding years. therefore if the customer is servicing 100% of the monthly interest amount, the balance in the table in section 8 may include some interest. for example, if a customer completes their initial advance on 2 january 2021 and has chosen to service 100% of their monthly interest amount with a payment date of the 15th of each month, section 8 of the kfi would show in year 1 the balance at the end of 2 january 2022. by this date interest has accumulated from 15 december 2021 (the last payment) to 2 january 2022. however the customer hasnt had a chance to pay that off as their direct debit date isnt until 15 january 2022. therefore the interest that has been accumulated is included in the balance in section 8. fees, remuneration and charges to find out more about fees,

technical guide how our lifetime mortgage works repayment of the lifetime mortgage a lifetime mortgage is a lifetime commitment. its designed to be repaid only when your customer (or both customers, in the case of borrowing jointly) has died or permanently moved into long-term care. the mortgage must be repaid within 12 months from when your customer (or both customers in the case of borrowing jointly) has died or permanently moved into long-term care. for example, your customer might move into a care home or live with and be cared for by relatives on a permanent basis due to medical necessity. if the mortgage isnt repaid within 12 months, we may appoint a representative to market and sell the property. if the mortgage is repaid at any time before the death or entry into permanent long-term care of all applicants, then the customer(s) may have to pay an early repayment charge. the mortgage may also have to be repaid if the property is left vacant for more than three months. usually the mortgage will be repaid from the sale proceeds of the property, but it can be repaid from other funds if needed. voluntary early repayment if your customer(s) repay their lifetime mortgage early, there may be an early repayment charge to pay. this is to protect us against the financial consequences of their decision not to keep the mortgage for the full term. we do not charge an exit administration fee for early repayment. the early repayment charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if the lifetime mortgage is repaid early. we offer two different early repayment charge options: variable and fixed. the type of early repayment charge must be chosen at outset. once the initial advance has completed, the type of early repayment charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the initial advance and all subsequent advances. please refer to the offer letter to understand which option applies to the lifetime mortgage. further details on the early repayment

charge. for each advance, they can pay back up to 10% of the advance amount in each 12-month period following completion, in up to six instalments providing they are not servicing any of the monthly interest amount. the minimum overall amount they can pay in each instalment is 500, and the remaining amount owed must be at least 10,000. if more than one advance has been taken, we will allocate the amount repaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. if the amount repaid is more than 10% there may be an early repayment charge payable. also, if the customer(s) sell their property and transfers the lifetime mortgage to a new property that is acceptable to us, we may ask them to make a part repayment. this may happen, for example, if the customer(s) new property is worth less than their existing one. if this happens, we wont charge an early repayment charge on that part repayment. no-negative-equity guarantee as long as the customers have complied with the terms and conditions, they wont have to pay more than the sale proceeds of the property, even if its less than the amount owed. theres no added charge for this guarantee. valuation report before we make an offer, we need a

want to move home, it may be possible to transfer their lifetime mortgage to a new property, if the new property is acceptable to us. one condition is that the sale of the old property and purchase of the new property take place at the same time. if the new property has a higher value than the old property, it may be possible to apply for a further advance. but this is subject to the lending criteria at the time. in some instances, for example if the customer is transferring the lifetime mortgage to a lower value property, we may reduce the cash facility. we may ask the customer to repay part of the amount owed in line with lending criteria applicable at the time. we do not charge an application fee for transferring the lifetime mortgage. if the customer has taken more than one advance, we will allocate the amount repaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. there will be no early repayment charge in these circumstances. if customers choose to repay more than required, an early repayment charge will apply only to the extra amount repaid. the new property will need to be valued by a surveyor. well choose a surveyor to do the valuation. the valuation fee will be the fee applicable to a new just lifetime mortgage at the time. your customer will be responsible for all the costs of moving. find out more about early repayment charges in our guide to early

park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr in our experience, it is sometimes intended that some (or all) of the proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from infinity mortgages and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we recommend that you do so. i enclose a form with this letter, and i should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. once you have completed the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. please be aware that i will not be able to complete your equity release until i am in receipt of a completed and signed form. please contact us directly

property jointly with somebody else (or transferring a new party onto a property title), whether or not you are married, you should think now about what the position will be if things go wrong or when the property is sold. there are two types of joint ownership of land available (the word 'tenancy' used in this information sheet has nothing to do with a landlord or tenant). please read this information carefully and return the instruction form on the last page to us duly completed. if you have any queries please contact us to discuss. joint tenancy the property is not owned in specified shares, but jointly own the whole. if one of the joint owners dies, their interest passes automatically to the surviving owner(s). this right of survivorship overrides any will the deceased owner may have made. couples who are divorcing or separating must seriously consider whether the joint tenancy should be severed in order to prevent this right of survivorship operating. by severing the joint tenancy, the owners automatically become tenants in common (as discussed below) and this would enable them to leave their interest in the property to whom they choose in their will. if the property is to be sold, and there is no agreement over the division in the proceeds of sale, the courts would have to be involved to make a decision. tenancy in common the property is jointly owned in specific shares e.g. 50/50. when one of the owners dies, their interest passes according to the deceaseds wishes expressed in their will (or according to the law of intestacy). what if a jointly owning couple separate? if a married couple are divorcing, the family court has wide powers to order a financial settlement under s.25 matrimonial causes act 1973. the powers include an order for sale of a property or one spouse transferring their interest in the property to the other. these powers only come in to play in the event of a divorce. the uk courts do not recognise any form of agreement or attempt to override the courts powers such as a pre-nuptual agreement. unmarried couples, living together, can also make claims against each other should the relationship end and they are unable to agree how the property should be dealt with. court proceedings can be brought under trusts of land and appointment of trustees act 1996. the court will consider how long the parties have been together, each partys financial contribution to the property and their way of life e.g. how domestic and utility bills have been paid, redecoration carried out and gardens landscaped etc. a declaration of trust can be entered into upon purchasing the property which sets out the proposed property division for each party should the relationship end. the court is not bound by this declaration and may view it simply as an intention of mind at the time when it was entered into. the declaration is one of many factors the court will consider and which can be overridden by the court, especially if the relationship has been a long one. in recent years partners have entered into written cohabitation agreements (also known as living together agreements), as above the court would view these as an intention of mind at the time they were entered into, and would not bind a court. business property where a property is purchased by two or more partners as a business enterprise, it is normally acquired by the partners as tenants in common. it is then advisable to stipulate the percentage share of each partner. most equity release providers stipulate that the property must not be used for business, although there are specific buy to let equity release products available. what if a joint owner becomes bankrupt? the bankrupts interest in the property passes initially to the official receiver as interim receiver and manager and subsequently either stays with the official receiver, or is passed to a private sector licensed insolvency practioner, as a trustee in bankruptcy. where the property is owned as joint tenants there is a presumption that the interest which passes into the bankruptcy is 50%. where there is a tenancy in common specifying the share, then the bankrupt owners share enters into the bankruptcy and nothing else. ", "1029": "where joint owners are faced both with separation and bankruptcy, bankruptcy rules which are predominant and not the rules of the family court. it is therefore vital that when property is initially purchased (or transferred) as joint tenants or as tenants in common the position is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, a corrective declaration of trust entered into to record the true position. wills if you have wills, you should seek advice regarding any amendments necessary as a result of your new ownership. general disclaimer the information contained herewith, is of a general nature only and should not be relied upon for specific advice. if you require further information please contact us to discuss. instructions for joint ownership client name: mrs. susan mcvay and mr. ray mcvay property: 23 park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr please confirm one of the following options: - we wish to own the property as joint tenants name of owner signature 1. 2. 3. 4. we wish to own the property as tenants in common please advise the percentage share of each owner and each joint owner should sign below: - name of owner percentage signature 1. % 2. % 3. % 4. % and we wish to make a declaration of trust deed", "1030": "reference: mcv0012/001 date: 02 december 2022 i have now drafted the transfer deed, which will transfer the property into your joint names only on completion, and enclose this for your attention. please ensure that you both sign the deed where indicated, in the presence of an independent witness (i.e. not a relative) who should also add his or her name and address alongside. kindly return this to me at your earliest convenience. please note that there will be an additional legal fee as per our terms and conditions to take into account the drafting of the transfer and the declaration of trust on completion. indemnity insurance \"demands and needs statement\" your property is currently held in the sole name of . your lender more 2 life requires you to hold the property jointly, on completion and, because is not paying market value for acquiring a share in the property, there is a risk under s. 339 of the insolvency act 1986 that the transaction could be reversed in the future if either of you were made bankrupt. if the transfer were to be reversed, more 2 life's security over your property is then at risk. to avoid this risk more 2 life insists that an indemnity insurance policy is in place on completion. this is a mandatory requirement and is no reflection on your financial status. jordan swinburn jordan.swinburn@equilaw.uk.com to book a call with me visit callbooking.equilaw.uk.com/jordanswinburn ", "1031": "confirmation of authority to proceed with indemnity insurance policy name of clients: mrs. susan mcvay and mr. ray mcvay address of property: 23 park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr we wish to select ..(product) at ..(cost). we give authority for the insurance policy premium to be deducted from the equity release fund received from more 2 life. we authorise equilaw to take out the insurance policy on (or as soon as reasonably practicable after) completion day. we confirm that the statement of facts at s.4 of the policy are correct and accurate; we confirm that i have no knowledge of a claim against 23 park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr we understand that i must not discuss the existence of the policy. signed: susan mcvay dated: signed: ray mcvay dated: ", "1032": "asset protection insurance insurance product information document this insurance product is provided by dual asset a trading name of dual corporate risks limited which is authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority, number 312593. registered in england and wales number 4160680, registered office: one creechurch place, london ec3a 5af. company: dual asset product: residential real estate - specific risk this is a summary of your insurance policy. you will find all the terms and conditions (along with other important information) in the policy. capitalised terms used in this summary have the meaning given to them in the definitions section of your policy. what is this type of insurance?

fraudsters over the last few years. these fraudsters have realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute

required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your equity release funds, we must guarantee your identity to the lenders. we can only do this by reference to government issued photographic identification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us as our

assume that you consent to do this unless you notify us to the contrary. scope of work equilaw ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the equity release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser infinity mortgages, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges if you have any secured loans, overdrafts or mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your equity release. fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 749.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds. disbursements disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control. we may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard equity release matter (and", "1066": "therefore outside of the fixed fee). as soon as we are aware of any we will notify you. signed plan please find enclosed a plan, obtained from the land registry, outlining what i believe to be the extent of your land, if this is

financial conduct authority: a lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or a regular income. the amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the sale of your home after death. if you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death of the last borrower. any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries. if you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. otherwise you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. any money left over belongs to you. if you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. again, any money left over belongs to you. if you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs to move into long-term care, you dont usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either dies or moves into long-term care or another property. if you decide that you simply dont want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount you owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do. section 13 of this offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage. some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment

institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%.

", "1131": "faq 1. do i have to send in my title deeds? if your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.", "1132":

contact karla or in her absence our compliance director david bush or our ceo claire barker (solicitor). security we take your protection against identity theft very seriously. we are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your equity release funds, we must guarantee your identity to the lenders. we can only do this by reference to government issued photographic identification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us as our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. if you do not have such documentation we will require you to complete our identity verification form. enclosed is our frequently asked questions sheet and cybercrime leaflet which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud. please note that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you notify us to the contrary. scope of work equilaw ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the equity release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. we cannot give you any advice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. if you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent financial adviser infinity mortgages, who can advise further. if you do require financial advice, before progressing your equity release, please let me know so that i can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed. the property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the ifa in the first instance. ordinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months. as we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend that you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems. the latest we can send documentation to the lenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. if the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid. equity release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a first and only legal charge (mortgage) to be registered on your property title at the land registry, with no other third party interest. homes for ukraine campaign you will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced homes for ukraine scheme https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk launched by the government, allowing uk homeowners to offer shelter to displaced ukrainian families. it is extremely important that you are aware that you must inform your lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss. currently, there is very little clarity around the homes for ukraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the government. lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all cases. if you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately. tax or financial advice we are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice. therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome. charges if you have any secured loans, overdrafts or mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your equity release. fees and expenses please see our attached estimated bill to deal with your equity release. we have agreed an all-inclusive fee of 749.00. the all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-forward. the fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and vat. the fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, we will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your equity release lender's requirement. any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains payable. ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the equity release funds. disbursements disbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control. we may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard equity release matter (and 2", "1140": "therefore outside of the fixed fee). as soon as we are aware of any we will notify you. signed plan please find enclosed a plan, obtained from the land registry, outlining what i believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return to me. if the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent. it is important that the plan is accurate. if you own any additional land, please identify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct. next steps please review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to enable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to equilaw such as account details for existing charges,

solicitor. on average there is a delay of approximately 3 working days between you receive the offer and us. if we have not contacted you after 3 days (from your receipt of the offer directly from legal & general home finance) please contact me so that i may chase legal & general home finance's solicitors for this documentation. once we receive the offer from legal & general home finance's solicitors, we will contact you to book a face to face appointment will our attending solicitor. we have produced a short information video demonstrating how the appointment can safely proceed https://youtu.be/e3grm6pp4fm . we would urge you to review the video so that you know what to expect and so that you can raise any question or queries relating to the appointment. we have been successfully conducting meetings in this manner since the start of the pandemic, so you are in safe hands with equilaw. we are: closely following public health england and nhs guidance, asking our attending solicitors to self-certify weekly that they have not (to the best of their knowledge) come into contact with any at risk individuals, arranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; re-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; adapting our face to face meetings to be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; ensuring that all staff are issued with ppe and sanitiser. we believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the erc guidelines, adhere to the law of property act requirements, adhere to the solicitors regulation authority code of conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. if you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know. it is a matter for you to decide if you wish to proceed. if there are additional precautions that can be taken to minimise any risk of infection to you, please let us know. it is mandatory, under law of property act 1925, for a deed to be lawfully executed that it must be executed in the presence of a physically present independent person. deeds cannot, under any circumstances, be executed via video call. once we have booked the appointment, we will send to you our legal report pack. this pack contains the documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our solicitor and without it the appointment cannot proceed. if you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us. completion we will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the lender to seek your authorisation to complete. as the action rests with legal & general home finances solicitors to carry out their pre-completion checks we cannot give a precise time estimate. our final bill and completion statement will be sent to you following completion. we will pay your net funds directly into your bank account by bacs in three days. if you wish to obtain your funds on the same day as completion we are able to offer a premium same day service if at an additional cost of 40 +vat. please notify us if you do want to upgrade to the premium payment service and we will amend our records, but please note that funds are usually not received from the lenders solicitors until mid-afternoon on the day of completion, such that same day transfer to you is not always possible. there are certain parts of the transaction where we must use same day bank transfer, for example, paying off an existing charge and this is beyond our control. after completion any original documents will be returned to you after completion. we will store our file for 6 years, as required by our regulators, after which time the file will be confidentially destroyed. we can offer extended secure off site storage of your file for 30 years at a cost of 25 plus vat, if you so wish. if you wish to take up this service, please let us know before completion.

these set out the basis on which we will charge you. this will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements). where we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date. where we are unable to complete your work within the

insurance policy being necessary to protect the client and/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider. where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the cost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule. shortfall if you believe that it

please notify us as soon as possible. 7", "1145": "billing and payment all final bills are due for payment on delivery. where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and severally with all those who are party to the instruction. we may charge interest at the prevailing county court judgment rate on any part of a bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery. we may also take recovery action through the courts, in which case we will add our own costs plus interest, court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can significantly increase the amount owed. you agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other associated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, ifa or introducer from monies received or held on your behalf (including monies

we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account. we expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. all interim statute bills are due for payment on delivery. payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling either by cheque payable to equilaw limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request). shortfalls and completion funds we do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage. we are obliged under the anti money laundering regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed. we are happy to accept debit card payments up to 2,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances. payment of sums in lieu of interest we occasionally hold client money on deposit with natwest bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation. all amounts held qualify for cover under the fsas deposit guarantee scheme. due to the fact we are a law firm and not a bank, technically we do not pay interest but sums in lieu of interest. however, from the inland revenues point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable). any payment of interest is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. it is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a bank and it follows that we can only accept client money in support of a specific transaction. you should not remit money to us until requested. we will normally hold money in a general client account on your behalf pending the legal transaction. we will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds 35; below this amount, it is considered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due. considered reasonable the following are example of factors to be considered: the nature of the transaction; amounts held and their duration; the purpose of us holding the funds. due to the current state of the financial markets, any interest paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (this will be reviewed periodically.) any interest paid will be gross of tax. (net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.) regulation and limits on our services we will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey report that the equity release lender commissions. we are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the suitability of

your property is registered at the land registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your title directly from them at a charge of 6. you will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your direct debit authority (if your application does not complete). if your property is unregistered we will require your title deeds in order to proceed. you will be asked to sign a form of authority allowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession. 2. i have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser. why do you want it as well? we are required, by your lenders solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the money laundering regulations requirements. to do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport. if you do not have this then an identify verification form should be completed. we can accept a certified copy identification from your adviser at the outset, but the attending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to provide the required guarantee to the lenders solicitor. 3. i have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser. cant they confirm the details with you? we have to provide details to the lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us. as you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion. 4. do i have to see a solicitor in person when signing the equity release documentation? yes. the solicitors appointment is a key requirement of the equity release council code of conduct and acts as a safety net to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the equity release and to guarantee your identity and address. a checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is required of them at the appointment. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitors' appointment. the solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitors appointment. 5. how do i book my solicitors appointment? depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our booking portal. we will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you within 15 minutes of booking the day. at 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within. if you do not receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot. every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. 6. i cannot travel to equilaws offices for the solicitors appointment. what can i do? we can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home. in the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor. you may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the appointment. 7. the solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me. please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitors office. 8. should we update our wills at the same time? making a will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a will is made or updated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage. additionally, you may wish to consider making a lasting power of attorney (lpa) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a drawdown product. 9. why should i instruct you and not a local solicitor? your local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of experience can cause delays. equilaw only do equity release related work and as such we are experienced specialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach. please review previous client feedback on webpage, twitter, linkedin and our industry awards. 10. when will you be in touch with me? there are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitors appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the net balance of your equity release and completion statement. if your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate and let you know when you can expect to hear from us next. 12", "1150": "additional fees (if required) (plus vat) mining

realised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred. they have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the fraudsters accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners. usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out. the popular name for all this criminal activity is cybercrime and it is increasingly prevalent. we take all reasonable steps to protect your information. however, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their approach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa). equally we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful interception. if you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details, published by the law society of england & wales, and speak to a director or someone who has been working with you. our head office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. last year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved exceeded 2 billion. the city of london police stated that the average loss was 112,000. we take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send us any payments that may be required. this will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us. we are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). when we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person. if you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999. what should you be looking out for? sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason. last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements. last minute requests for more money for no clear reason. callers that dont seem to know any details about the transaction. requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you. the cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent. emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to dear client. how can you protect yourself? dont trust call back numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently. dont click on contact us or email us links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us. check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes. check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you. we will never ask our accounts department to contact you directly without us informing you first. and finally if you sense that something might be wrong in a communication to you from us then it probably is! 17", "1155": "reference: mcv0012/001 date: 14 november 2022 mrs. susan mcvay and mr. ray mcvay 23 park lane colney heath st albans al4 0nr dear mrs. susan mcvay and mr. ray mcvay property: 23 park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr in our experience, it is sometimes intended that some (or all) of the proceeds from a lifetime mortgage are used to make a gift, usually to help a family member. as your solicitors we are required to ensure that you are fully aware of the potential risks associated with making such a gift, so that we may be confident that you are making an informed decision. the funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be aware of the possible consequences: in certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate deprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need to be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are seeking. should you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for example, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of the gift. making a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. you may, therefore, wish to consider covering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they are to be considered when distributing your estate. we have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from infinity mortgages and it may be that you have already addressed the matter with them. if, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we recommend that you do so. i enclose a form with this letter, and i should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. once you have completed the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. please be aware that i will not be able to complete your equity release until i am in receipt of a completed and signed form. please contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand or if you would like to discuss in more detail. yours

financial conduct authority: a lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or a regular income. the amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the sale of your home after death. if you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death of the last borrower. any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries. if you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. otherwise you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. any money left over belongs to you. if you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. again, any money left over belongs to you. if you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs to move into long-term care, you dont usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either dies or moves into long-term care or another property. if you decide that you simply dont want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount you owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do. section 13 of this offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage. some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment

may be higher). if the mortgage re-offer is at a higher rate of interest this will increase the amount paid over the lifetime of the loan or, if you are servicing the interest payments, these will rise and you should ensure that this is affordable. please speak to your financial adviser for an illustration of the rolled up interest at the new rate. whilst equilaw cannot take any responsibility

"1301": " the objective of this report is to identify the key elements of your selected equity release mortgage plan, to advise you of your legal obligations and the effect of the equity release mortgage on you and the property. in term of suitability for your needs, you must rely entirely on the financial advice and guidance provided by your financial adviser or the plan providers representative. equilaw cannot give you any financial advice regarding the plans suitability for your circumstances and requirements, now or in the future. if you are not absolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your financial adviser before proceeding further. if you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you have sought further financial advice, from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment may not exceed the interest charged on this product. any existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the property must be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release. if you do not intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding further. unless we hear from you to the contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity release funds paid to you on completion. additionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the equity release. the effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against your home. please ensure that you have reviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances. if this applies in your case, you will find details in the special conditions section of this report. you may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance tax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees. the rules and regulations relating to gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. the equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose, without careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. please also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life. further information and guidance is produced by age uk and can be found at www.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information- guides-and-factsheets/ . it is important to review and/or make a will in the context of taking out an equity release plan. making a will can achieve significant savings in tax and costs of winding up your estate. it also means that your assets will be distributed in accordance with your wishes and not as provided for by the general laws of intestacy. you should also consider making a lasting power of attorney, which can safeguard your position and ensure that your wishes are carried out in relation to the property, health and finances in the event that you become incapable of handling these decisions personally in the future. if you would like to discuss these matters please let me know and i will put you in touch with an appropriate specialist. you should read this report, together with the mortgage deed, the loan agreement and the more 2 life mortgage terms and conditions (hereinafter referred to as \"the conditions\") before committing to the scheme. if there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact jordan swinburn or your financial adviser vijay ghudial before you proceed. you should not go ahead with the scheme until you are satisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy with it. fraud warning we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly. if you receive any telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number which can be found on our letterhead. 7", "1302": "1. what is the equity release scheme? 1.1 product type following advice from your financial adviser, vijay ghudial, more 2 life capital choice midi drawdown lifetime mortgage, lifetime general loan conditions and mortgage conditions (2020 ed-v1) has been selected as the most suitable product for your requirements. this is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home. 1.2 amount of loan the maximum amount that more 2 life are willing to lend is 191,625.00. at the date of completion, you will receive a lump sum of 150,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). you will also have access to a cash facility of 41,624.90. more 2 life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the property as security for this loan. you can apply to more 2 life for additional borrowing. more 2 life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. 1.3 cash facility following completion, you will have access to a cash facility of 41,624.90. you will not be charged interest on the cash facility until you draw funds from it. when you do withdraw funds, more 2 life will charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher or lower than the original rate in this offer of 7.91%. please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the cash facility. you can apply at any time, to more 2 life to borrow any amount within your cash facility subject to a minimum amount of 2,000.00. please note that the cash facility can be withdrawn by more 2 life at any time following completion, as outlined in section 5 of your mortgage offer. if this is likely to pose a problem for you, you should speak to your financial adviser immediately and before you proceed any further. 1.4 interest the interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 7.91%. interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly. you are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. unpaid interest will be added to the loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (rolling up). the interest continues to roll up, at the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid. over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments). if house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the property will be eroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the property. the requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the property has been abandoned. this will either be because you have died, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the property. please note that interest continues to roll up until the mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the property); it will not stop just because you are no longer living there. section 8 of the offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. the loan period may be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest which accrues. the annual percentage rate is 8.3%. 1.5 inheritance protection more 2 life offers inheritance protection. this allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the property, but ultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow. you have opted not to protect any of the equity in the property. please note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to opt for inheritance protection will have been lost. if you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would like to protect a proportion of the property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to 8", "1303": "completion. 1.6 no negative equity guarantee. more 2 life provides a no negative equity guarantee. this means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or your estate owe more than the value of your home, more 2 life will not seek to recover any further amount than the proceeds of sale. this guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the terms and conditions of the plan. for example, keeping the property in good repair and condition. the guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by more 2 life. the guarantee only applies when the property is sold to repay the loan. it will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the property and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your property will reduce the available equity for a new property. all of the lenders that belong to the equity release council offer a no-negative equity guarantee which means that if the level of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any shortfall. however, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee. this is not specified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so i cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything). the downside is that if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not need. however, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable. there is not currently an equity release council approved product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which meets council standards, there is no alternative. if you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your financial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you. 1.7 once the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of the loan you are taking, versus the value of your property. compound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future). 1.8 moving house it is possible to move to a different property, under the terms of the scheme (please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions) provided that the property you want to move to is acceptable to more 2 life. however, this is not guaranteed. examples of where more 2 life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another property might include a flat, where the lease does not have enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the property is of non-standard construction. if more 2 life are agreeable to porting your mortgage to a new property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. if you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve more 2 life from the outset. the solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with more 2 lifes solicitors at all stages to ensure that more 2 life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend. only once more 2 life have confirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to exchange. you must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new property without more 2 lifes consent. if your proposed new property is not acceptable to more 2 life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract an early repayment charge. if your proposed new home does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge. you should always obtain more 2 life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in the event that this is not possible 1.9 sale of part of your property if you are seeking to sell part of your property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell more 2 life and seek more 2 lifes prior consent. if the sale of part of your property reduces the value of your property you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. 1.10 taxation on the loan 9", "1304": "the loan is tax-free under present legislation. whilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and governments can apply any new rules retrospectively. if such a change occurred, you may have to pay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax position. however, this is unlikely. 10", "1305": "2. what will it cost to set up? 2.1 financial advisers fee we have been advised by infinity mortgages that fees of 1,200.00 have been agreed between you. we will pay this amount directly to infinity mortgages from your completion funds. 2.2 legal fees you are responsible for equilaws fees, disbursements and vat of 1,117.80, as detailed in our initial estimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for extra work, as applicable. 2.3 other costs more 2 life and/or their solicitors may, from time to time, have additional disbursement costs. we are not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is provided with the intended completion date. we will always make you aware of any additional disbursements as soon as we are made aware. 11", "1306": "3. your obligations and what you have agreed to do 3.1 borrowing you have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) out of the equity release funds and cannot use your home as security for any further borrowing, unless more 2 life gives its written permission. 3.2 who can live in the property? only the people named in the mortgage offer are allowed to live at the property. 3.3 moving a new person into the property if you want somebody else to move into your home, you must seek more 2 lifes authority to do so. the new occupier will be required to sign the lender's occupier's waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees) before they move in. if you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan in the name of the proposed joint owners. if more 2 life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to repay part of the loan (without early repayment charge). 3.4 residence this must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. if you are planning to leave your property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform more 2 life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so. it is important that you do this so that more 2 life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges. you must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the property. usually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the property empty for 30 days or more. 3.5 you can live in the property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage conditions). please carefully read more 2 lifes terms and conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions (including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the terms and conditions). 3.6 right to inspect the property more 2 life is entitled to inspect the property periodically to ensure that the terms and conditions of the loan are being complied with. more 2 life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of emergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse. this is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is set out at section 10 in the terms and conditions. 3.7 repair & maintenance you have agreed to keep the property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting it fall into disrepair. if more 2 life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done within the time stipulated or more 2 life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it. if you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage and interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up. please also note that if you do not keep the property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out the repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee. 3.8 insurance you must keep the property fully insured, by a company approved by more 2 life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to 12", "1307": "restore the property, to its present condition. if it is damaged or destroyed the policy should include cover demolition, site clearance and architects plans to rebuild the property. the reinstatement sum insured as assessed by more 2 lifes valuer and must be no less than 260,000.00. we will require sight of the new insurance policy prior to completion, to enable us to demonstrate that it meets more 2 lifes requirements. more 2 life should be noted on your buildings insurance as per the terms and conditions and you may need to send more 2 life a copy of your buildings insurance each year, so that they can check that you have the necessary insurance cover. if the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. a copy will be required for completion, please send to us, if not already done so. if you do not insure your property more 2 life will do this for you but will re-charge you for the cost of the insurance to you. you must pay these sums once notified, should you fail to do so more 2 life will charge interest on the amount outstanding. these costs will fall outside of the no negative equity guarantee. you should also note that any insurance arranged by more 2 life will be suitable for more 2 lifes purposes but many not be suitable for you. we recommend that you always source your own index linked insurance. if an insurable event e.g. a fire, occurs you must immediately inform more 2 life. any monies paid under the insurance policy to you must be used to repair and make good the loss and damage or repay the total debt owing. 3.9 impact on your estate you should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate which you are able to leave to them on your death. it is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the property to move into long term care. they will need to notify more 2 life of this event and be aware of more 2 lifes requirements regarding repayment of the loan. 3.10 legal notice, orders or proposals effecting your property. you must inform more 2 life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the property. 3.11 alterations to the property you must seek more 2 lifes permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the property (e.g., new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations approval) this is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from more 2 life in principle as, if the lender refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work. lenders do not usually withhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects. if you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as green deal) you must first obtain the written permission of more 2 life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the property, which is not allowed by more 2 life). 3.12 acquiring additional land adjoining the property if you buy or acquire any land next to the property please notify more 2 life. more 2 life may require you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land. this is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the property (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions. 3.13 renting out the property you cannot rent out the property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself. if you wish to do so, please contact more 2 life. if more 2 life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a buy to let loan. your financial adviser will be able to assist you. 3.14 business use you cannot use your home for business purposes. if you wish to do so you must contact more 2 life to seek its permission. 13", "1308": "3.15 impact on benefits receipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits. if you think you may be entitled to any such benefits, or you receive means- tested benefits already, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore your options in advance of taking up this equity release. 3.16 special conditions imposed by more 2 life the following special conditions, that must be satisfied in order to complete your equity release, have been imposed: flooding confirmation your mortgage offer contains a special condition requiring us to confirm that the property has not been flooded within the last 5 years. please sign and return the enclosed declaration to confirm this to us so that we can comply with this condition. if you are unable to confirm that the property has not flooded during this time period, kindly contact us to provide us with further information and we will advise you how to proceed. 14", "1309": "4. when does the loan have to be repaid? 4.1 the loan contract ends when: the last owner of the property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of care in the terms and conditions, which you should read carefully); or if you purchase another property and the loan cannot be ported; or the property is permanently abandoned; or if you become bankrupt; or if you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the terms and conditions. the amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by more 2 life (for example repair costs). the term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 18 years. this does not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase. 4.2 impact of loan ending due to death or long term care if the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then more 2 life may request medical or other specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). the term will also end on death. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). 4.3 sale of the property you or your attorney (if you have appointed one under a power of attorney) or personal representatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the property. if the property is not sold within 12 months more 2 life may take over conduct of the sale. this would usually be if more 2 life perceived no progress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances. by signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint more 2 life under a power of attorney in relation to the property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. that said, if you are still capable of dealing with your own affairs, or have your own attorney, more 2 life would not usually get involved. however, it does mean that more 2 life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the property, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the property at the end of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so. 4.4 bankruptcy and/or breach of material contract terms the loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the terms and conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in the terms and conditions. please note that early repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances. 4.5 early repayment charges. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the terms and conditions. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this prior to the 10 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge. the early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date: up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid; up to the 10th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid; after the 10th anniversary is no charge. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at 15", "1310": "any time. however, if you chose to do this you may incur an early repayment charge. if you wish to repay your loan early, we suggest contacting more 2 life for a redemption statement. 4.6 exemption from early repayment charges no early repayment charge will be made if: the 10th anniversary of the completion date has passed; you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies; you port your loan to a new property of lower value and are required to repay a balancing amount; after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your new property does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria; the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage to the property; or if the mortgage is repaid by the remaining borrower within three years of the death or entry into long term care of the first borrower. 4.7 voluntary partial early repayments more 2 life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge provided: the total amount of voluntary payments does not exceed 10% of the total cash advanced per annum; minimum payment of 50, unlimited instalments. please note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, the early repayment charge will attach. where you do make partial repayments this will reduce the level of loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up. any unused 10% annual allowance cannot be carried forward to subsequent periods. if you plan to move house, as set out above, and a partial repayment is required due to your new home being of lower value no early repayment charge will be payable. 16", "1311": "5. what are the advantages? 5.1 you will have an immediate lump sum of 150,000.00 to use as you wish, unless you have used the funds to clear existing debts. you also have a cash facility of 41,624.90. 5.2 you retain ownership of your home. 5.3 you can port your loan to new property, provided that the onward property is acceptable to more 2 life. 5.4 more 2 life does not expect repayment of this loan during your lifetime (unless/until the surviving borrower is in long term care which brings the contract to an end) and you do not have to make payments whilst you are living at the property. you have the option to repay in full, should you so wish, which will be subject to the early repayment calculation as set out above. 5.5 subject to you complying with the terms and conditions, more 2 life offers a no-negative equity guarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the property, even if the level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in your home. 17", "1312": "6. what are the disadvantages? 6.1 means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits may be affected. you should therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. 6.2 the loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in your home over time, where no voluntary repayments are made, particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of your home. 6.3 further loans against the property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by more 2 life while its loan is still in existence. a further advance from more 2 life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in your property. 6.4 if you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt the property can be repossessed and the no negative equity guarantee may be revoked. 6.5 this is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the property is repossessed). for your peace of mind, more 2 life have set a maximum figure which can be charged of 11,123.99, this allows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging. the calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of the offer. 18", "1313": "7. conclusions: risk -v- reward it is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the risks of entering into this agreement. risk 7.1 if you seriously breach the terms and conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the property could be repossessed and sold to repay the loan. this may incur early repayment charges. if you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by more 2 life as a result of the breaches. more 2 life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach. repossession would always be a matter of last resort. 7.2 if you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances. further additional secured borrowing from more 2 life is not guaranteed. 7.3 if you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you wished to re-mortgage with another lender. 7.4 if the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump sum that you have taken. 7.5 if you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments) , particularly if the value of the property does not go up over time. this means that you would not be able to leave this property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the property have been sold. 7.6 eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. 7.7 any existing charge secured against the property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion. 7.8 if your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt secured against your home. you should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the best course of action for you. reward: 7.9 you will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use. 7.10 there is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home (provided there are no breaches of the terms and conditions). 7.11 you can potentially port this mortgage to a new property if you want to move house. 19", "1314": "8. what happens next? 8.1 please read and consider this report carefully, together with the mortgage offer and the terms and conditions. if you are willing to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive to outweigh the risks involved the next step is to arrange a signing appointment to complete the required documentation. if you are still unsure, or we can clarify any aspect for you, please do not hesitate to contact jordan swinburn. you should keep this report for future reference. 8.2 appointment in order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully. it is a matter of law that the deed must be executed in the physical presence of an independent person. the equity release council (\"erc\") guidelines require this to be a solicitor. the attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation and not to provide you with any legal advice. legal advice is provided by us within this mortgage report. if you have any questions or queries arising from this report, please direct these to jordan swinburn in advance of the appointment. in preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed document checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are available. if any documents are missing, please contact jordan swinburn prior to the appointment so we can arrange for any replacement documents to be sent to you in readiness. if the missing documents are those in your care and control, but are unavailable, please contact jordan swinburn so that we can discuss how best to proceed. we anticipate that the solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. the solicitor will need to verify your identity at the appointment and take copies of the documentation provided. please ensure you have: valid photographic signature identification: i.e passport, driving licence, national identity card and address verification: i.e bank statement; utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current council tax bill naming each borrower. very occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing appointment. to minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via skype or facetime. if you are not able to access this via your own (or a family/friends) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local solicitor who will charge 5 per document witnessing fee. if this is required, we will notify you and provide our skype/facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. 8.3 cost of the solicitor appointment the costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting. if you cancel or fail to attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to be met. if you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency. 8.4 identification we must provide a guarantee of your identity to more 2 life at the point of requesting completion. to be able to give this guarantee we will need valid photographic identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport. if you do not have such identity verification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity. please see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories. please contact jordan swinburn to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required guarantee. additionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly. if there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your birth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). if there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: your most recent council tax invoice and a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a dwp pensions letter. if you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or discrepancy to resolve please let jordan swinburn in advance of the signing appointment, so that we can instruct your attending solicitor to obtain all necessary documentation. 20", "1315": "8.5 next steps once we have received your signed documentation we endeavour to send all documentation to more 2 lifes solicitor within 2 working days by guaranteed next day special delivery. we can only forward these documents when all required conditions have been satisfied and all documentation received. please ensure the document checklist has been fully completed. on a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately 15 working days from this point. this timescale is only an estimate and is not guaranteed. as such, we strongly recommend that you do not commit funds until we confirm completion is taking place, which we will do by telephone in advance. if your case has any additional elements we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, because we are often waiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and impossible to guarantee. jordan swinburn will keep you up to date with progress on your case. on a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately three to four weeks from this point. we will endeavour to secure the earliest possible completion date (if that is what you would like) but if there is any particular urgency attaching to your case, or significance around a date (including a need to delay) please inform jordan swinburn so that we can do our best to achieve your expectations. 8.6 completion arrangements more 2 lifes solicitors enact will contact us with a completion date once final checks have been carried out by the team there. we will telephone you to go through the final completion figures and to give you a final opportunity to change your mind. please contact jordan swinburn if you are likely to be unavailable to discuss your case by telephone, at any time during the next four weeks (on standard cases). if we cannot reach you, we will delay completion until such time as we can speak to you. if this is likely to cause you a problem, or if you have any queries about this, please let us know as soon as possible. 8.7 receipt of funds on completion day more 2 lifes solicitors will send your funds to us. sometimes funds are not received until late afternoon and, in such circumstances, we may not be able to process the funds within banking hours. we will always process your funds on the next working day when we receive funds too late to process on the same day. please contact jordan swinburn if you have not received your cheque within 4 working days after completion. please ensure that you have read and understand all sections of your mortgage report and mortgage offer. if you have any queries regarding any aspects of your equity release please do not hesitate to contact your case handler jordan swinburn. we will not proceed to completion with the equity release until you are happy with all of the terms and conditions outlined above. 21", "1316": "summary of risks mcv0012/001 the property: 23 park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr the client: mrs. susan mcvay and mr. ray mcvay important please read the following notes before signing the legal charge, offer and/or any associated lifetime mortgage paperwork. more 2 life will hold this mortgage of the property as security for the equity release loan, all interest and any associated costs and disbursements described in the legal charge and mortgage offer. you must sign the legal charge in front of a solicitor, chartered legal executive, licensed conveyancer or barrister (who should have a current practising certificate and professional indemnity insurance). for convenience, all will be referred to as solicitor for the purposes of this statement. we susan mary mcvay and ray mcvay of 23 park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr make this statement of truth as follows:- 1. we confirm we instructed equilaw (\"my solicitor\") to act on our behalf in this matter and that we were told by infinity mortgages that we were free to instruct a solicitor of our choice. 2. we are fully satisfied that our solicitor has properly advised us on the nature effects and implications of our entering into the equity release plan. 3. we have read a copy of our solicitors equity release report dated 02/12/2022 and we are satisfied with the contents therein and fully understand the same. 4. we are not suffering from any physical or mental condition that prevents me/us from understanding the advice i/we have had or will receive from my/our solicitor (equilaw) or which precludes me/us from entering into the equity release contract. 5. we are aware of the implications should we decide to participate in the homes for ukraine scheme and that we must inform our lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if we fail to do so, we will immediately breach the terms and conditions of our mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with us, they can pursue us for that loss. 6. the interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan could wipe out the whole of the value of our property in due course. this means that we would not be able to leave our property or any part of it to beneficiaries under our will. 7. we are not under any undue influence or external pressure from any other party (including our family members) to proceed with this equity release contract. 8. we have been advised to seek independent expert legal and financial advice in relation to any gift or loan of money which we will make from the equity release contract. 9. we are aware that the equity release plan is intended to run for the rest of our lives or until the last owner occupier has passed away or gone into permanent residential care. early repayment charges are usually repayable should we decide to repay the loan early or if we decide to sell the property and live elsewhere. the maximum charge payable in this case is 11123.99 as set out in section 13 of the mortgage offer. accessing any further draw down will result in a higher charge being payable. 10. we have been advised to discuss the equity release contract with my family and other beneficiaries and am aware that taking out the equity release plan will reduce the value of the assets we may wish to leave to others. 11. we confirm that we have been advised that equilaw must notify the lender of any material change in circumstances that may prevent the equity release from completing (for example (but not limited to) something affecting the applicant(s) such as deterioration in health, or something affecting the property such as boundary dispute). we are aware that equilaw must be notified as soon as reasonably possible should our circumstances change. 12. we are aware that the lender does have the right after we or the last owner occupier dies or moves into permanent residential 22", "1317":

general loan conditions and mortgage conditions (2020 ed-v1) has been selected as the most suitable product for your requirements. this is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home. 1.2 amount of loan the maximum amount that more 2 life are willing to lend is 191,625.00. at the date of completion, you will receive a lump sum of 150,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). you will also have access to a cash facility of 41,624.90. more 2 life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the property as security for this loan. you can apply to more 2 life for additional borrowing. more 2 life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. 1.3 cash facility following completion, you will have access to a cash facility of 41,624.90. you will not be charged interest on the cash facility until you draw funds from it. when you do withdraw funds, more 2 life will charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher or lower than the original rate in this offer of 7.91%. please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the cash facility. you can apply at any time, to more 2 life to borrow any amount within your cash facility subject to a minimum amount of 2,000.00. please note that the cash facility can be withdrawn by more 2 life at any time following completion, as outlined in section 5 of your mortgage offer. if this is likely to pose a problem for you, you should speak to your financial adviser immediately and before you proceed any further. 1.4 interest the interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 7.91%. interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly. you are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. unpaid interest will be added to the loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (rolling up). the interest continues to roll up, at the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid. over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments). if house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the property will be eroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the property. the requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the property has been abandoned. this will either be because you have died, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the property. please note that interest continues to roll up until the mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the property); it will not stop just because you are no longer living there. section 8 of the offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. the loan period may be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest which accrues. the annual percentage rate is 8.3%. 1.5 inheritance protection more 2 life offers inheritance protection. this allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the property, but ultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow. you have opted not to protect any of the equity in the property. please note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to opt for inheritance protection will have been lost. if you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would like to protect a proportion of the property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to", "1330": "completion. 1.6 no negative equity guarantee. more 2 life provides a no negative equity guarantee. this means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or your estate owe more than the value of your home, more 2 life will not seek to recover any further amount than the proceeds of sale. this guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the terms and conditions of the plan. for example, keeping the property in good repair and condition. the guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by more 2 life. the guarantee only applies when the property is sold to repay the loan. it will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the property and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your property will reduce the available equity for a new property. all of the lenders that belong to the equity release council offer a no-negative equity guarantee which means that if the level of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any shortfall. however, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee. this is not specified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so i cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything). the downside is that if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not need. however, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable. there is not currently an equity release council approved product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which meets council standards, there is no alternative. if you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your financial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you. 1.7 once the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of the loan you are taking, versus the value of your property. compound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future). 1.8 moving house it is possible to move to a different property, under the terms of the scheme (please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions) provided that the property you want to move to is acceptable to more 2 life. however, this is not guaranteed. examples of where more 2 life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another property might include a flat, where the lease does not have enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the property is of non-standard construction. if more 2 life are agreeable to porting your mortgage to a new property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. if you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve more 2 life from the outset. the solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with more 2 lifes solicitors at all stages to ensure that more 2 life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend. only once more 2 life have confirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to exchange. you must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new property without more 2 lifes consent. if your proposed new property is not acceptable to more 2 life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract an early repayment charge. if your proposed new home does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge. you should always obtain more 2 life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in the event that this is not possible 1.9 sale of part of your property if you are seeking to sell part of your property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell more 2 life and seek more 2 lifes prior consent. if the sale of part of your property reduces the value of your property you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. 1.10 taxation on the loan", "1331": "the loan is tax-free under present legislation. whilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and governments can apply any new rules retrospectively. if such a change occurred, you may have to pay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax position. however, this is unlikely.", "1332": "2. what will it cost to set up? 2.1 financial advisers fee we have been advised by infinity mortgages that fees of 1,200.00 have been agreed between you. we will pay this amount directly to infinity mortgages from your completion funds. 2.2 legal fees you are responsible for equilaws fees, disbursements and vat of 1,117.80, as detailed in our initial estimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for extra work, as applicable. 2.3 other costs more 2 life and/or their solicitors may, from time to time, have additional disbursement costs. we are not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is provided with the intended completion date. we will always make you aware of any additional disbursements as soon as we are made aware. ", "1333": "3. your obligations and what you have agreed to do 3.1 borrowing you have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) out of the equity release funds and cannot use your home as security for any further borrowing, unless more 2 life gives its written permission. 3.2 who can live in the property? only the people named in the mortgage offer are allowed to live at the property. 3.3 moving a new person into the property if you want somebody else to move into your home, you must seek more 2 lifes authority to do so. the new occupier will be required to sign the lender's occupier's waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees) before they move in. if you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan in the name of the proposed joint owners. if more 2 life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to repay part of the loan (without early repayment charge). 3.4 residence this must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. if you are planning to leave your property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform more 2 life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so. it is important that you do this so that more 2 life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges. you must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the property. usually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the property empty for 30 days or more. 3.5 you can live in the property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage conditions). please carefully read more 2 lifes terms and conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions (including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the terms and conditions). 3.6 right to inspect the property more 2 life is entitled to inspect the property periodically to ensure that the terms and conditions of the loan are being complied with. more 2 life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of emergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse. this is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is set out at section 10 in the terms and conditions. 3.7 repair & maintenance you have agreed to keep the property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting it fall into disrepair. if more 2 life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done within the time stipulated or more 2 life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it. if you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage and interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up. please also note that if you do not keep the property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out the repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee. 3.8 insurance you must keep the property fully insured, by a company approved by more 2 life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to", "1334": "restore the property, to its present condition. if it is damaged or destroyed the policy should include cover demolition, site clearance and architects plans to rebuild the property. the reinstatement sum insured as assessed by more 2 lifes valuer and must be no less than 260,000.00. we will require sight of the new insurance policy prior to completion, to enable us to demonstrate that it meets more 2 lifes requirements. more 2 life should be noted on your buildings insurance as per the terms and conditions and you may need to send more 2 life a copy of your buildings insurance each year, so that they can check that you have the necessary insurance cover. if the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. a copy will be required for completion, please send to us, if not already done so. if you do not insure your property more 2 life will do this for you but will re-charge you for the cost of the insurance to you. you must pay these sums once notified, should you fail to do so more 2 life will charge interest on the amount outstanding. these costs will fall outside of the no negative equity guarantee. you should also note that any insurance arranged by more 2 life will be suitable for more 2 lifes purposes but many not be suitable for you. we recommend that you always source your own index linked insurance. if an insurable event e.g. a fire, occurs you must immediately inform more 2 life. any monies paid under the insurance policy to you must be used to repair and make good the loss and damage or repay the total debt owing. 3.9 impact on your estate you should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate which you are able to leave to them on your death. it is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the property to move into long term care. they will need to notify more 2 life of this event and be aware of more 2 lifes requirements regarding repayment of the loan. 3.10 legal notice, orders or proposals effecting your property. you must inform more 2 life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the property. 3.11 alterations to the property you must seek more 2 lifes permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the property (e.g., new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations approval) this is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from more 2 life in principle as, if the lender refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work. lenders do not usually withhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects. if you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as green deal) you must first obtain the written permission of more 2 life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the property, which is not allowed by more 2 life). 3.12 acquiring additional land adjoining the property if you buy or acquire any land next to the property please notify more 2 life. more 2 life may require you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land. this is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the property (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions. 3.13 renting out the property you cannot rent out the property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself. if you wish to do so, please contact more 2 life. if more 2 life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a buy to let loan. your financial adviser will be able to assist you. 3.14 business use you cannot use your home for business purposes. if you wish to do so you must contact more 2 life to seek its permission.", "1335": "3.15 impact on benefits receipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits. if you think you may be entitled to any such benefits, or you receive means- tested benefits already, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore your options in advance of taking up this equity release. 3.16 special conditions imposed by more 2 life the following special conditions, that must be satisfied in order to complete your equity release, have been imposed: flooding confirmation your mortgage offer contains a special condition requiring us to confirm that the property has not been flooded within the last 5 years. please sign and return the enclosed declaration to confirm this to us so that we can comply with this condition. if you are unable to confirm that the property has not flooded during this time period, kindly contact us to provide us with further information and we will advise you how to proceed.", "1336": "4. when does the loan have to be repaid? 4.1 the loan contract ends when: the last owner of the property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of care in the terms and conditions, which you should read carefully); or if you purchase another property and the loan cannot be ported; or the property is permanently abandoned; or if you become bankrupt; or if you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the terms and conditions. the amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by more 2 life (for example repair costs). the term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 18 years. this does not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase. 4.2 impact of loan ending due to death or long term care if the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then more 2 life may request medical or other specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). the term will also end on death. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). 4.3 sale of the property you or your attorney (if you have appointed one under a power of attorney) or personal representatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the property. if the property is not sold within 12 months more 2 life may take over conduct of the sale. this would usually be if more 2 life perceived no progress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances. by signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint more 2 life under a power of attorney in relation to the property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. that said, if you are still capable of dealing with your own affairs, or have your own attorney, more 2 life would not usually get involved. however, it does mean that more 2 life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the property, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the property at the end of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so. 4.4 bankruptcy and/or breach of material contract terms the loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the terms and conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in the terms and conditions. please note that early repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances. 4.5 early repayment charges. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the terms and conditions. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this prior to the 10 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge. the early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date: up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid; up to the 10th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid; after the 10th anniversary is no charge. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at", "1337": "any time. however, if you chose to do this you may incur an early repayment charge. if you wish to repay your loan early, we suggest contacting more 2 life for a redemption statement. 4.6 exemption from early repayment charges no early repayment charge will be made if: the 10th anniversary of the completion date has passed; you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies; you port your loan to a new property of lower value and are required to repay a balancing amount; after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your new property does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria; the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage to the property; or if the mortgage is repaid by the remaining borrower within three years of the death or entry into long term care of the first borrower. 4.7 voluntary partial early repayments more 2 life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge provided: the total amount of voluntary payments does not exceed 10% of the total cash advanced per annum; minimum payment of 50, unlimited instalments. please note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, the early repayment charge will attach. where you do make partial repayments this will reduce the level of loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up. any unused 10% annual allowance cannot be carried forward to subsequent periods. if you plan to move house, as set out above, and a partial repayment is required due to your new home being of lower value no early repayment charge will be payable.", "1338": "5. what are the advantages? 5.1 you will have an immediate lump sum of 150,000.00 to use as you wish, unless you have used the funds to clear existing debts. you also have a cash facility of 41,624.90. 5.2 you retain ownership of your home. 5.3 you can port your loan to new property, provided that the onward property is acceptable to more 2 life. 5.4 more 2 life does not expect repayment of this loan during your lifetime (unless/until the surviving borrower is in long term care which brings the contract to an end) and you do not have to make payments whilst you are living at the property. you have the option to repay in full, should you so wish, which will be subject to the early repayment calculation as set out above. 5.5 subject to you complying with the terms and conditions, more 2 life offers a no-negative equity guarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the property, even if the level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in your home. ", "1339": "6. what are the disadvantages? 6.1 means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits may be affected. you should therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. 6.2 the loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in your home over time, where no voluntary repayments are made, particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of your home. 6.3 further loans against the property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by more 2 life while its loan is still in existence. a further advance from more 2 life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in your property. 6.4 if you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt the property can be repossessed and the no negative equity guarantee may be revoked. 6.5 this is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the property is repossessed). for your peace of mind, more 2 life have set a maximum figure which can be charged of 11,123.99, this allows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging. the calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of the offer.", "1340": "7. conclusions: risk -v- reward it is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the risks of entering into this agreement. risk 7.1 if you seriously breach the terms and conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the property could be repossessed and sold to repay the loan. this may incur early repayment charges. if you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by more 2 life as a result of the breaches. more 2 life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach. repossession would always be a matter of last resort. 7.2 if you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances. further additional secured borrowing from more 2 life is not guaranteed. 7.3 if you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you wished to re-mortgage with another lender. 7.4 if the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump sum that you have taken. 7.5 if you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments) , particularly if the value of the property does not go up over time. this means that you would not be able to leave this property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the property have been sold. 7.6 eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. 7.7 any existing charge secured against the property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion. 7.8 if your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt secured against your home. you should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the best course of action for you. reward: 7.9 you will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use. 7.10 there is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home (provided there are no breaches of the terms and conditions). 7.11 you can potentially port this mortgage to a new property if you want to move house.", "1341": "8. what happens next? 8.1 please read and consider this report carefully, together with the mortgage offer and the terms and conditions. if you are willing to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive to outweigh the risks involved the next step is to arrange a signing appointment to complete the required documentation. if you are still unsure, or we can clarify any aspect for you, please do not hesitate to contact jordan swinburn. you should keep this report for future reference. 8.2 appointment in order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully. it is a matter of law that the deed must be executed in the physical presence of an independent person. the equity release council (\"erc\") guidelines require this to be a solicitor. the attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation and not to provide you with any legal advice. legal advice is provided by us within this mortgage report. if you have any questions or queries arising from this report, please direct these to jordan swinburn in advance of the appointment. in preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed document checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are available. if any documents are missing, please contact jordan swinburn prior to the appointment so we can arrange for any replacement documents to be sent to you in

the appointment and take copies of the documentation provided. please ensure you have: valid photographic signature identification: i.e passport, driving licence, national identity card and address verification: i.e bank statement; utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current council tax bill naming each borrower. very occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing appointment. to minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via skype or facetime. if you are not able to access this via your own (or a family/friends) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local solicitor who will charge 5 per document witnessing fee. if this is required, we will notify you and provide our skype/facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. 8.3 cost of the solicitor appointment the costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting. if you cancel or fail to attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to be met. if you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency. 8.4 identification we must provide a guarantee of your identity to more 2 life at the point of requesting completion. to be able to give this guarantee we will need valid photographic identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport. if you do not have such identity verification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity. please see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories. please contact jordan swinburn to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required guarantee. additionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly. if there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your birth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). if there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: your most recent council tax invoice and a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a dwp pensions letter. if you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or discrepancy to resolve please let jordan swinburn in advance of the signing appointment, so that we can instruct your attending solicitor to obtain all necessary documentation.", "1342": "8.5 next steps once we have received your signed documentation we endeavour to send all documentation to more 2 lifes solicitor within 2 working days by guaranteed next day

"lifetime mortgage offer 3. what is a lifetime mortgage? important information from the financial conduct authority: a lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or a regular income. the amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the sale of your home after death. if you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death of the last borrower. any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries. if you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. otherwise you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. any money left over belongs to you. if you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. again, any money left over belongs to you. if you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs to move into long-term care, you dont usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either dies or moves into long-term care or another property. if you decide that you simply dont want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount you owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do. section 13 of this offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage. some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment this means you borrow a lump sum which is invested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. if this happens the full details of the investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents together. 4. what you have told us you want an offer for the

mortgage? important information from the financial conduct authority: a lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or a regular income. the amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the sale of your home after death. if you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death of the last borrower. any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries. if you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. otherwise you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. any money left over belongs to you. if you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. again, any money left over belongs to you. if you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs to move into long-term care, you dont usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either dies or moves into long-term care or another property. if you decide that you simply dont want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount you owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do. section 13 of this offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage. some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment this means you borrow a lump sum which is invested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. if this happens the full details of the investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents together. 4. what you have told us you want an offer for the capital choice midi drawdown lifetime mortgage. your

ed-v1) (\"the terms and conditions\") for mrs. susan mcvay and mr. ray mcvay 23 park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr (\"the property\") please keep this document safe - do not return. 6", "1486": " the objective of this report is to identify the key elements of your selected equity release mortgage plan, to advise you of your legal obligations and the effect of the equity release mortgage on you and the property. in term of suitability for your needs, you must rely entirely on the financial advice and guidance provided by your financial adviser or the plan providers representative. equilaw cannot give you any financial advice regarding the plans suitability for your circumstances and requirements, now or in the future. if you are not absolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your financial adviser before proceeding further. if you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you have sought further financial advice, from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment may not exceed the interest charged on this product. any existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the property must be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release. if you do not intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding further. unless we hear from you to the contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity release funds paid to you on completion. additionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the equity release. the effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against your home. please ensure that you have reviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances. if this applies in your case, you will find details in the special conditions section of this report. you may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance tax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees. the rules and regulations relating to gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. the equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose, without careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. please also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life. further information and guidance is produced by age uk and can be found at www.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information- guides-and-factsheets/ . it is important to review and/or make a will in the context of taking out an equity release plan. making a will can achieve significant savings in tax and costs of winding up your estate. it also means that your assets will be distributed in accordance with your wishes and not as provided for by the general laws of intestacy. you should also consider making a lasting power of attorney, which can safeguard your position and ensure that your wishes are carried out in relation to the property, health and finances in the event that you become incapable of handling these decisions personally in the future. if you would like to discuss these matters please let me know and i will put you in touch with an appropriate specialist. you should read this report, together with the mortgage deed, the loan agreement and the more 2 life mortgage terms and conditions (hereinafter referred to as \"the conditions\") before committing to the scheme. if there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact jordan swinburn or your financial adviser vijay ghudial before you proceed. you should not go ahead with the scheme until you are satisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy with it. fraud warning we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. we will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly. if you receive any telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number which can be found on our letterhead. 7", "1487": "1. what is the equity release scheme? 1.1 product type following advice from your financial adviser, vijay ghudial, more 2 life capital choice midi drawdown lifetime mortgage, lifetime general loan conditions and mortgage conditions (2020 ed-v1) has been selected as the most suitable product for your requirements. this is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home. 1.2 amount of loan the maximum amount that more 2 life are willing to lend is 191,625.00. at the date of completion, you will receive a lump sum of 150,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). you will also have access to a cash facility of 41,624.90. more 2 life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the property as security for this loan. you can apply to more 2 life for additional borrowing. more 2 life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. 1.3 cash facility following completion, you will have access to a cash facility of 41,624.90. you will not be charged interest on the cash facility until you draw funds from it. when you do withdraw funds, more 2 life will charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher or lower than the original rate in this offer of 7.91%. please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the cash facility. you can apply at any time, to more 2 life to borrow any amount within your cash facility subject to a minimum amount of 2,000.00. please note that the cash facility can be withdrawn by more 2 life at any time following completion, as outlined in section 5 of your mortgage offer. if this is likely to pose a problem for you, you should speak to your financial adviser immediately and before you proceed any further. 1.4 interest the interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 7.91%. interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly. you are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. unpaid interest will be added to the loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (rolling up). the interest continues to roll up, at the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid. over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments). if house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the property will be eroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the property. the requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the property has been abandoned. this will either be because you have died, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the property. please note that interest continues to roll up until the mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the property); it will not stop just because you are no longer living there. section 8 of the offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. the loan period may be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest which accrues. the annual percentage rate is 8.3%. 1.5 inheritance protection more 2 life offers inheritance protection. this allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the property, but ultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow. you have opted not to protect any of the equity in the property. please note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to opt for inheritance protection will have been lost. if you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would like to protect a proportion of the property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to 8", "1488": "completion. 1.6 no negative equity guarantee. more 2 life provides a no negative equity guarantee. this means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or your estate owe more than the value of your home, more 2 life will not seek to recover any further amount than the proceeds of sale. this guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the terms and conditions of the plan. for example, keeping the property in good repair and condition. the guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by more 2 life. the guarantee only applies when the property is sold to repay the loan. it will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the property and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your property will reduce the available equity for a new property. all of the lenders that belong to the equity release council offer a no-negative equity guarantee which means that if the level of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any shortfall. however, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee. this is not specified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so i cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything). the downside is that if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not need. however, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable. there is not currently an equity release council approved product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which meets council standards, there is no alternative. if you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your financial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you. 1.7 once the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of the loan you are taking, versus the value of your property. compound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future). 1.8 moving house it is possible to move to a different property, under the terms of the scheme (please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions) provided that the property you want to move to is acceptable to more 2 life. however, this is not guaranteed. examples of where more 2 life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another property might include a flat, where the lease does not have enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the property is of non-standard construction. if more 2 life are agreeable to porting your mortgage to a new property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. if you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve more 2 life from the outset. the solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with more 2 lifes solicitors at all stages to ensure that more 2 life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend. only once more 2 life have confirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to exchange. you must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new property without more 2 lifes consent. if your proposed new property is not acceptable to more 2 life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract an early repayment charge. if your proposed new home does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge. you should always obtain more 2 life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in the event that this is not possible 1.9 sale of part of your property if you are seeking to sell part of your property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell more 2 life and seek more 2 lifes prior consent. if the sale of part of your property reduces the value of your property you may be required to repay some of the loan. no early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. 1.10 taxation on the loan 9", "1489": "the loan is tax-free under present legislation. whilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and governments can apply any new rules retrospectively. if such a change occurred, you may have to pay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax position. however, this is unlikely. 10", "1490": "2. what will it cost to set up? 2.1 financial advisers fee we have been advised by infinity mortgages that fees of 1,200.00 have been agreed between you. we will pay this amount directly to infinity mortgages from your completion funds. 2.2 legal fees you are responsible for equilaws fees, disbursements and vat of 1,117.80, as detailed in our initial estimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for extra work, as applicable. 2.3 other costs more 2 life and/or their solicitors may, from time to time, have additional disbursement costs. we are not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is provided with the intended completion date. we will always make you aware of any additional disbursements as soon as we are made aware. 11", "1491": "3. your obligations and what you have agreed to do 3.1 borrowing you have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) out of the equity release funds and cannot use your home as security for any further borrowing, unless more 2 life gives its written permission. 3.2 who can live in the property? only the people named in the mortgage offer are allowed to live at the property. 3.3 moving a new person into the property if you want somebody else to move into your home, you must seek more 2 lifes authority to do so. the new occupier will be required to sign the lender's occupier's waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees) before they move in. if you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan in the name of the proposed joint owners. if more 2 life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to repay part of the loan (without early repayment charge). 3.4 residence this must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. if you are planning to leave your property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform more 2 life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so. it is important that you do this so that more 2 life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges. you must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the property. usually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the property empty for 30 days or more. 3.5 you can live in the property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage conditions). please carefully read more 2 lifes terms and conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions (including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the terms and conditions). 3.6 right to inspect the property more 2 life is entitled to inspect the property periodically to ensure that the terms and conditions of the loan are being complied with. more 2 life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of emergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse. this is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is set out at section 10 in the terms and conditions. 3.7 repair & maintenance you have agreed to keep the property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting it fall into disrepair. if more 2 life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done within the time stipulated or more 2 life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it. if you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage and interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up. please also note that if you do not keep the property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out the repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee. 3.8 insurance you must keep the property fully insured, by a company approved by more 2 life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to 12", "1492": "restore the property, to its present condition. if it is damaged or destroyed the policy should include cover demolition, site clearance and architects plans to rebuild the property. the reinstatement sum insured as assessed by more 2 lifes valuer and must be no less than 260,000.00. we will require sight of the new insurance policy prior to completion, to enable us to demonstrate that it meets more 2 lifes requirements. more 2 life should be noted on your buildings insurance as per the terms and conditions and you may need to send more 2 life a copy of your buildings insurance each year, so that they can check that you have the necessary insurance cover. if the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. a copy will be required for completion, please send to us, if not already done so. if you do not insure your property more 2 life will do this for you but will re-charge you for the cost of the insurance to you. you must pay these sums once notified, should you fail to do so more 2 life will charge interest on the amount outstanding. these costs will fall outside of the no negative equity guarantee. you should also note that any insurance arranged by more 2 life will be suitable for more 2 lifes purposes but many not be suitable for you. we recommend that you always source your own index linked insurance. if an insurable event e.g. a fire, occurs you must immediately inform more 2 life. any monies paid under the insurance policy to you must be used to repair and make good the loss and damage or repay the total debt owing. 3.9 impact on your estate you should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate which you are able to leave to them on your death. it is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the property to move into long term care. they will need to notify more 2 life of this event and be aware of more 2 lifes requirements regarding repayment of the loan. 3.10 legal notice, orders or proposals effecting your property. you must inform more 2 life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the property. 3.11 alterations to the property you must seek more 2 lifes permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the property (e.g., new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations approval) this is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from more 2 life in principle as, if the lender refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work. lenders do not usually withhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects. if you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as green deal) you must first obtain the written permission of more 2 life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the property, which is not allowed by more 2 life). 3.12 acquiring additional land adjoining the property if you buy or acquire any land next to the property please notify more 2 life. more 2 life may require you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land. this is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the property (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. please see more 2 lifes terms and conditions. 3.13 renting out the property you cannot rent out the property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself. if you wish to do so, please contact more 2 life. if more 2 life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a buy to let loan. your financial adviser will be able to assist you. 3.14 business use you cannot use your home for business purposes. if you wish to do so you must contact more 2 life to seek its permission. 13", "1493": "3.15 impact on benefits receipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits. if you think you may be entitled to any such benefits, or you receive means- tested benefits already, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore your options in advance of taking up this equity release. 3.16 special conditions imposed by more 2 life the following special conditions, that must be satisfied in order to complete your equity release, have been imposed: flooding confirmation your mortgage offer contains a special condition requiring us to confirm that the property has not been flooded within the last 5 years. please sign and return the enclosed declaration to confirm this to us so that we can comply with this condition. if you are unable to confirm that the property has not flooded during this time period, kindly contact us to provide us with further information and we will advise you how to proceed. 14", "1494": "4. when does the loan have to be repaid? 4.1 the loan contract ends when: the last owner of the property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of care in the terms and conditions, which you should read carefully); or if you purchase another property and the loan cannot be ported; or the property is permanently abandoned; or if you become bankrupt; or if you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the terms and conditions. the amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by more 2 life (for example repair costs). the term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 18 years. this does not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase. 4.2 impact of loan ending due to death or long term care if the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then more 2 life may request medical or other specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). the term will also end on death. no early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold). 4.3 sale of the property you or your attorney (if you have appointed one under a power of attorney) or personal representatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the property. if the property is not sold within 12 months more 2 life may take over conduct of the sale. this would usually be if more 2 life perceived no progress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances. by signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint more 2 life under a power of attorney in relation to the property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. that said, if you are still capable of dealing with your own affairs, or have your own attorney, more 2 life would not usually get involved. however, it does mean that more 2 life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the property, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the property at the end of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so. 4.4 bankruptcy and/or breach of material contract terms the loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the terms and conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in the terms and conditions. please note that early repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances. 4.5 early repayment charges. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the terms and conditions. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. however, if you chose to do this prior to the 10 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge. the early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date: up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid; up to the 10th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid; after the 10th anniversary is no charge. early repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default. it is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at 15", "1495": "any time. however, if you chose to do this you may incur an early repayment charge. if you wish to repay your loan early, we suggest contacting more 2 life for a redemption statement. 4.6 exemption from early repayment charges no early repayment charge will be made if: the 10th anniversary of the completion date has passed; you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies; you port your loan to a new property of lower value and are required to repay a balancing amount; after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your new property does not meet more 2 life's lending criteria; the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage to the property; or if the mortgage is repaid by the remaining borrower within three years of the death or entry into long term care of the first borrower. 4.7 voluntary partial early repayments more 2 life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge provided: the total amount of voluntary payments does not exceed 10% of the total cash advanced per annum; minimum payment of 50, unlimited instalments. please note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, the early repayment charge will attach. where you do make partial repayments this will reduce the level of loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up. any unused 10% annual allowance cannot be carried forward to subsequent periods. if you plan to move house, as set out above, and a partial repayment is required due to your new home being of lower value no early repayment charge will be payable. 16", "1496": "5. what are the advantages? 5.1 you will have an immediate lump sum of 150,000.00 to use as you wish, unless you have used the funds to clear existing debts. you also have a cash facility of 41,624.90. 5.2 you retain ownership of your home. 5.3 you can port your loan to new property, provided that the onward property is acceptable to more 2 life. 5.4 more 2 life does not expect repayment of this loan during your lifetime (unless/until the surviving borrower is in long term care which brings the contract to an end) and you do not have to make payments whilst you are living at the property. you have the option to repay in full, should you so wish, which will be subject to the early repayment calculation as set out above. 5.5 subject to you complying with the terms and conditions, more 2 life offers a no-negative equity guarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the property, even if the level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in your home. 17", "1497": "6. what are the disadvantages? 6.1 means-tested state benefits, such as pension credit or council tax benefits may be affected. you should therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. 6.2 the loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in your home over time, where no voluntary repayments are made, particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of your home. 6.3 further loans against the property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by more 2 life while its loan is still in existence. a further advance from more 2 life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in your property. 6.4 if you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt the property can be repossessed and the no negative equity guarantee may be revoked. 6.5 this is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the property is repossessed). for your peace of mind, more 2 life have set a maximum figure which can be charged of 11,123.99, this allows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging. the calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of the offer. 18", "1498": "7. conclusions: risk -v- reward it is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the risks of entering into this agreement. risk 7.1 if you seriously breach the terms and conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the property could be repossessed and sold to repay the loan. this may incur early repayment charges. if you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by more 2 life as a result of the breaches. more 2 life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach. repossession would always be a matter of last resort. 7.2 if you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances. further additional secured borrowing from more 2 life is not guaranteed. 7.3 if you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you wished to re-mortgage with another lender. 7.4 if the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump sum that you have taken. 7.5 if you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary repayments) , particularly if the value of the property does not go up over time. this means that you would not be able to leave this property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the property have been sold. 7.6 eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. 7.7 any existing charge secured against the property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion. 7.8 if your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt secured against your home. you should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the best course of action for you. reward: 7.9 you will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use. 7.10 there is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home (provided there are no breaches of the terms and conditions). 7.11 you can potentially port this mortgage to a new property if you want to move house. 19", "1499": "8. what happens next? 8.1 please read and consider this report carefully, together with the mortgage offer and the terms and conditions. if you are willing to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive to outweigh the risks involved the next step is to arrange a signing appointment to complete the required documentation. if you are still unsure, or we can clarify any aspect for you, please do not hesitate to contact jordan swinburn. you should keep this report for future reference. 8.2 appointment in order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully. it is a matter of law that the deed must be executed in the physical presence of an independent person. the equity release council (\"erc\") guidelines require this to be a solicitor. the attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation and not to provide you with any legal advice. legal advice is provided by us within this mortgage report. if you have any questions or queries arising from this report, please direct these to jordan swinburn in advance of the appointment. in preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed document checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are available. if any documents are missing, please contact jordan swinburn prior to the appointment so we can arrange for any replacement documents to be sent to you in readiness. if the missing documents are those in your care and control, but are unavailable, please contact jordan

for the solicitor's appointment. the solicitor will need to verify your identity at the appointment and take copies of the documentation provided. please ensure you have: valid photographic signature identification: i.e passport, driving licence, national identity card and address verification: i.e bank statement; utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current council tax bill naming each borrower. very occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing appointment. to minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via skype or facetime. if you are not able to access this via your own (or a family/friends) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local solicitor who will charge 5 per document witnessing fee. if this is required, we will notify you and provide our skype/facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. 8.3 cost of the solicitor appointment the costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting. if you cancel or fail to attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to be met. if you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency. 8.4 identification we must provide a guarantee of your identity to more 2 life at the point of requesting completion. to be able to give this guarantee we will need valid photographic identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport. if you do not have such identity verification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity. please see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories. please contact jordan swinburn to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required guarantee. additionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly. if there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your birth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). if there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: your most recent council tax invoice and a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a dwp pensions letter. if you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or discrepancy to resolve please let jordan swinburn in advance of the signing appointment, so that we can instruct your attending solicitor to obtain all necessary documentation. 20", "1500": "8.5 next steps once we have received your signed documentation we endeavour to send all documentation to more 2 lifes solicitor within 2 working days by guaranteed next day special delivery. we can only forward these documents when all required conditions have been satisfied and all documentation received. please ensure the document checklist has been fully completed. on a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately 15 working days from this point. this timescale is only an estimate and is not guaranteed. as such, we strongly recommend that you do not commit funds until we confirm completion is taking place, which we will do by telephone in advance. if your case has any additional elements we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, because we are often waiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and impossible to guarantee. jordan swinburn will keep you up to date with progress on your case. on a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately three to four weeks from this point. we will endeavour to secure the earliest possible completion date (if that is what you would like) but if there is any particular urgency attaching to your case, or significance around a date (including a need to delay) please inform jordan swinburn so that we can do our best to achieve your expectations. 8.6 completion arrangements more 2 lifes solicitors enact will contact us with a completion date once final checks have been carried out by the team there. we will telephone you to go through the final completion figures and to give you a final opportunity to change your mind. please contact jordan swinburn if you are likely to be unavailable to discuss your case by telephone, at any time during the next four weeks (on standard cases). if we cannot reach you, we will delay completion until such time as we can speak to you. if this is likely to cause you a problem, or if you have any queries about this, please let us know as soon as possible. 8.7 receipt of funds on completion day more 2 lifes solicitors will send your funds to us. sometimes funds are not received until late afternoon and, in such circumstances, we may not be able to process the funds within banking hours. we will always process your funds on the next working day when we receive funds too late to process on the same day. please contact jordan swinburn if you have not received your cheque within 4 working days after completion. please ensure that you have read and understand all sections of your mortgage report and mortgage offer. if you have any queries regarding any aspects of your equity release please do not hesitate to contact your case handler jordan swinburn. we will not proceed to completion with the equity release until you are happy with all of the terms and conditions

all interest and any associated costs and disbursements described in the legal charge and mortgage offer. you must sign the legal charge in front of a solicitor, chartered legal executive, licensed conveyancer or barrister (who should have a current practising certificate and professional indemnity insurance). for convenience, all will be referred to as solicitor for the purposes of this statement. we susan mary mcvay and ray mcvay of 23 park lane, colney heath, st albans, al4 0nr make this statement of truth as follows:- 1. we confirm we instructed equilaw (\"my solicitor\") to act on our behalf in this matter and that we were told by infinity mortgages that we were free to instruct a solicitor of our choice. 2. we are fully satisfied that our solicitor has properly advised us on the nature effects and implications of our entering into the equity release plan. 3. we have read a copy of our solicitors equity release report dated 02/12/2022 and we are satisfied with the contents therein and fully understand the same. 4. we are not suffering from any physical or mental condition that prevents me/us from understanding the advice i/we have had or will receive from my/our solicitor (equilaw) or which precludes me/us from entering into the equity release contract. 5. we are aware of the implications should we decide to participate in the homes for ukraine scheme and that we must inform our lender and obtain their consent before taking in any occupiers, including ukrainian or other refugees. if we fail to do so, we will immediately breach the terms and conditions of our mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation. if the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with us, they can pursue us for that loss. 6. the interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the loan could wipe out the whole of the value of our property in due course. this means that we would not be able to leave our property or any part of it to beneficiaries under our will. 7. we are not under any undue influence or external pressure from any other party (including our family members) to proceed with this equity release contract. 8. we have been advised to seek independent expert legal and financial advice in relation to any gift or loan of money which we will make from the equity release contract. 9. we are aware that the equity release plan is intended to run for the rest of our lives or until the last owner occupier has passed away or gone into permanent residential care. early repayment charges are usually repayable should we decide to repay the loan early or if we decide to sell the property and live elsewhere. the maximum charge payable in this case is 11123.99 as set out in section 13 of the mortgage offer. accessing any further draw down will result in a higher charge being payable. 10. we have been advised to discuss the equity release contract with my family and other beneficiaries and am aware that taking out the equity release plan will reduce the value of the assets we may wish to leave to others. 11. we confirm that we have been advised that equilaw must notify the lender of any material change in circumstances that may prevent the equity release from completing (for example (but not limited to) something affecting the applicant(s) such as deterioration in health, or something affecting the property such as boundary dispute). we are aware that equilaw must be notified as soon as reasonably possible should our circumstances change. 12. we are aware that the lender does have the right after we or the last owner occupier dies or moves into permanent residential 22", "1502":

property jointly with somebody else (or transferring a new party onto a property title), whether or not you are married, you should think now about what the position will be if things go wrong or when the property is sold. there are two types of joint ownership of land available (the word 'tenancy' used in this information sheet has nothing to do with a landlord or tenant). please read this information carefully and return the instruction form on the last page to us duly completed. if you have any queries please contact us to discuss. joint tenancy the property is not owned in specified shares, but jointly own the whole. if one of the joint owners dies, their interest passes automatically to the surviving owner(s). this right of survivorship overrides any will the deceased owner may have made. couples who are divorcing or separating must seriously consider whether the joint tenancy should be severed in order to prevent this right of survivorship operating. by severing the joint tenancy, the owners automatically become tenants in common (as discussed below) and this would enable them to leave their interest in the property to whom they choose in their will. if the property is to be sold, and there is no agreement over the division in the proceeds of sale, the courts would have to be involved to make a decision. tenancy in common the property is jointly owned in specific shares e.g. 50/50. when one of the owners dies, their interest passes according to the deceaseds wishes expressed in their will (or according to the law of intestacy). what if a jointly owning couple separate? if a married couple are divorcing, the family court has wide powers to order a financial settlement under s.25 matrimonial causes act 1973. the powers include an order for sale of a property or one spouse transferring their interest in the property to the other. these powers only come in to play in the event of a divorce. the uk courts do not recognise any form of agreement or attempt to override the courts powers such as a pre-nuptual agreement. unmarried couples, living together, can also make claims against each other should the relationship end and they are unable to agree how the property should be dealt with. court proceedings can be brought under trusts of land and appointment of trustees act 1996. the court will consider how long the parties have been together, each partys financial contribution to the property and their way of life e.g. how domestic and utility bills have been paid, redecoration carried out and gardens landscaped etc. a declaration of trust can be entered into upon purchasing the property which sets out the proposed property division for each party should the relationship end. the court is not bound by this declaration and may view it simply as an intention of mind at the time when it was entered into. the declaration is one of many factors the court will consider and which can be overridden by the court, especially if the relationship has been a long one. in recent years partners have entered into written cohabitation agreements (also known as living together agreements), as above the court would view these as an intention of mind at the time they were entered into, and would not bind a court. business property where a property is purchased by two or more partners as a business enterprise, it is normally acquired by the partners as tenants in common. it is then advisable to stipulate the percentage share of each partner. most equity release providers stipulate that the property must not be used for business, although there are specific buy to let equity release products available. what if a joint owner becomes bankrupt? the bankrupts interest in the property passes initially to the official receiver as interim receiver and manager and subsequently either stays with the official receiver, or is passed to a private sector licensed insolvency practioner, as a trustee in bankruptcy. where the property is owned as joint

if a married couple are divorcing, the family court has wide powers to order a financial settlement under s.25 matrimonial causes act 1973. the powers include an order for sale of a property or one spouse transferring their interest in the property to the other. these powers only come in to play in the event of a divorce. the uk courts do not recognise any form of agreement or attempt to override the courts powers such as a pre-nuptual agreement. unmarried couples, living together, can also make claims against each other should the relationship end and they are unable to agree how the property should be dealt with. court proceedings can be brought under trusts of land and appointment of trustees act 1996. the court will consider how long the parties have been together, each partys financial contribution to the property and their way of life e.g. how domestic and utility bills have been paid, redecoration carried out and gardens landscaped etc. a declaration of trust can be entered into upon purchasing the property which sets out the proposed property division for each party should the relationship end. the court is not bound by this declaration and may view it simply as an intention of mind at the time when it was entered into. the declaration is one of many factors the court will consider and which can be overridden by the court, especially if the relationship has been a long one. in recent years partners have entered into written cohabitation agreements (also known as living together agreements), as above the court would view these as an intention of mind at the time they were entered into, and would not bind a court. business property where a property is purchased by two or more partners as a business enterprise, it is normally acquired by the partners as tenants in common. it is then advisable to stipulate the percentage share of each partner. most equity release providers stipulate that the property must not be used for business, although there are specific buy to let equity release products available. what if a joint owner becomes bankrupt? the bankrupts interest in the property passes initially to the official receiver as interim receiver and manager and subsequently either stays with the official receiver, or is passed to a private sector licensed insolvency practioner, as a trustee in bankruptcy. where the property is owned as joint tenants there is a presumption that the interest which passes into the bankruptcy is 50%. where there is a tenancy in common specifying the share, then the bankrupt owners share enters into the bankruptcy and nothing else.

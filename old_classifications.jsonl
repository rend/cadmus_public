The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\r\naware of the possible consequences:\r\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\r\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\r\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\r\nseeking.\r\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\r\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\r\nthe gift.\r\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\r\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\r\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\r\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from Viva Retirement Solutions and it may be that you have\r\nalready addressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release\r\nfunds, we recommend that you do so.  \r\nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. Once you have\r\ncompleted the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. Please be aware that I will not be able to\r\ncomplete your equity release until I am in receipt of a completed and signed form.\r\n \r\nPlease contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand or if you would like to discuss\r\nin more detail.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nNatasha Wakefield\r\nnatasha.wakefield@equilaw.uk.com\r\nTo book a call with me visit callbooking.equilaw.uk.com/NatashaWakefield\r\n "}

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \nnot have\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\nForm.\nIn order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your \nexact\n bank details otherwise the banking system will\nreject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you.  In order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent\nbank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment.\nEnclosed is our \nFrequently Asked Questions\n sheet and \nCybercrime Leaflet\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\nnotify us to the contrary.\n \nScope of Work\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\nFinancial Adviser Viva Retirement Solutions, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let\nme know so that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \nfirst and only\n legal charge (mortgage) to\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\n launched by the\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\nTax or Financial advice\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\nCharges\nIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your Equity Release.\nFees and Expenses\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3699.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\nDisbursements\n2"}

As soon as we are aware of any we will notify you.\nMarketing Fees \nBoth Equilaw and Viva Retirement Solutions\n \nspecialise in the equity release industry. As such, we have a relationship with them which includes mutual\nadvertising, the monitoring of completion times and a dedication to ensuring a smooth transaction.\n \nThere is also a financial relationship between us whereby Equilaw pays a monthly marketing contribution of \u00a311,000.00\n. \n \nDespite this relationship, we will provide you with independent advice and you are able to raise questions with us about any aspect of your case.\nSigned Plan\nPlease find enclosed a plan, obtained from the Land Registry, outlining what I believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return\nto me.  If the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent.  It is important that the plan is accurate. If you own any additional land, please\nidentify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct.\nNext Steps\nPlease review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to\nenable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to Equilaw such as account details for existing charges,\ndetails of any occupiers or your management company (if Leasehold) details.  On receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer\nthrough to completion. The offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lender\u2019s solicitors (who will then send it to us).\nWe will issue and send you a \"\nLegal Report Pack\". \nThis pack will come directly from Equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you will\nreceive from More 2 Life directly.\nOffers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. We will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from More 2 Life's\nsolicitors. We have to await this pack of documents as it contains the legal documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our solicitor. On\naverage there is a delay of approximately 3 working days between you receive the offer and us. If we have not contacted you after 3 days (from your\nreceipt of the offer directly from More 2 Life) please contact me so that I may chase More 2 Life's solicitors for this documentation.\nOnce we receive the offer from More 2 Life's solicitors, we will contact you to book a face to face appointment will our attending solicitor. \nWe have produced a short information video demonstrating how the appointment can safely proceed \nhttps://youtu.be/e3GRm6PP4FM\n. We would urge\nyou to review the video so that you know what to expect and so that you can raise any question or queries relating to the appointment.\nWe have been successfully conducting meetings in this manner since the start of the pandemic, so you are in safe hands with Equilaw. We are: \nclosely following Public Health England and NHS guidance,  \nasking our attending solicitors to self-certify weekly that they have not (to the best of their knowledge) come into contact with any \u2018at risk\u2019\nindividuals,  \narranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; \nre-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; \nadapting our face to face meetings\n \nto be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; \nensuring that all staff are issued with PPE and sanitiser. \nWe believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the ERC Guidelines, adhere to the Law of\nProperty Act requirements, adhere to the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. \nIf you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know.  It is a matter for you to\ndecide if you wish to proceed.\u00e2\u20ac\u00af If there are additional precautions that can be taken to minimise any risk of infection to you, please let us know.  \nIt is mandatory, under Law of Property Act 1925, for a deed to be lawfully executed that it MUST be executed in the presence of a physically\npresent independent person. Deeds cannot, under any circumstances, be executed via video call.    \nOnce we have booked the appointment, we will send to you our \n\u201cLegal Report Pack\u201d.\n  This pack contains the documents that you will need to sign in the\npresence of our solicitor and without it the appointment cannot proceed.   \nIf you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us.\n \nCompletion\nWe will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the Lender to seek your authorisation to complete. As the action rests with More 2 Life\u2019s\nsolicitors to carry out their pre-completion checks we cannot give a precise time estimate.\nOur final bill and completion statement will be sent to you following completion.  We will pay your net funds directly into your bank account by BACS in\nthree days. If you wish to obtain your funds on the same day as completion we are able to offer a premium same day service if at an additional cost of \u00a340\n+VAT.  Please notify us if you do want to upgrade to the premium payment service and we will amend our records, but please note that funds are usually\nnot received from the lenders solicitors until mid-afternoon on the day of completion, such that same day transfer to you is not always possible. There are\ncertain parts of the transaction where we must use same day bank transfer, for example, paying off an existing charge and this is beyond our control.\n3"}

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\naware of the possible consequences:\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\nseeking.\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\nthe gift.\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from Viva Retirement Solutions and it may be that you have\nalready addressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release\nfunds, we recommend that you do so.  \nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable.

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\n \nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\nIndemnity Insurance\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible.\n10"}

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\nmade.

Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted.

Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \nShortfalls and Completion Funds\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128500", "filename": "128500/17.pdf", "page_num": 15, "text": "FAQ\n1. \nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\n10. \nWhen will you be in touch with me? \nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.\n15"}

These fraudsters have realised\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\ninterception. \nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\nWhat should you be looking out for?\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\nHow can you protect yourself?\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!\n19"}

These fraudsters have realised\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\ninterception. \nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\nWhat should you be looking out for?\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\nHow can you protect yourself?\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!"}

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \nnot have\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\nForm.\nIn order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your \nexact\n bank details otherwise the banking system will\nreject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you.  In order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent\nbank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment.\nEnclosed is our \nFrequently Asked Questions\n sheet and \nCybercrime Leaflet\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\nnotify us to the contrary.\n \nScope of Work\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\nFinancial Adviser Viva Retirement Solutions, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let\nme know so that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \nfirst and only\n legal charge (mortgage) to\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\n launched by the\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\nTax or Financial advice\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\nCharges\nIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your Equity Release.\nFees and Expenses\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3699.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\nDisbursements"}

As such, we have a relationship with them which includes mutual\nadvertising, the monitoring of completion times and a dedication to ensuring a smooth transaction.\n \nThere is also a financial relationship between us whereby Equilaw pays a monthly marketing contribution of \u00a311,000.00\n. \n \nDespite this relationship, we will provide you with independent advice and you are able to raise questions with us about any aspect of your case.\nSigned Plan\nPlease find enclosed a plan, obtained from the Land Registry, outlining what I believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return\nto me.

On receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer\nthrough to completion. The offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lender\u2019s solicitors (who will then send it to us).\nWe will issue and send you a \"\nLegal Report Pack\". \nThis pack will come directly from Equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you will\nreceive from More 2 Life directly.\nOffers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. We will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from More 2 Life's\nsolicitors. We have to await this pack of documents as it contains the legal documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our solicitor. On\naverage there is a delay of approximately 3 working days between you receive the offer and us. If we have not contacted you after 3 days (from your\nreceipt of the offer directly from More 2 Life) please contact me so that I may chase More 2 Life's solicitors for this documentation.\nOnce we receive the offer from More 2 Life's solicitors, we will contact you to book a face to face appointment will our attending solicitor. \nWe have produced a short information video demonstrating how the appointment can safely proceed \nhttps://youtu.be/e3GRm6PP4FM\n. We would urge\nyou to review the video so that you know what to expect and so that you can raise any question or queries relating to the appointment.\nWe have been successfully conducting meetings in this manner since the start of the pandemic, so you are in safe hands with Equilaw.

It is a matter for you to\ndecide if you wish to proceed.\u00e2\u20ac\u00af If there are additional precautions that can be taken to minimise any risk of infection to you, please let us know.  \nIt is mandatory, under Law of Property Act 1925, for a deed to be lawfully executed that it MUST be executed in the presence of a physically\npresent independent person. Deeds cannot, under any circumstances, be executed via video call.    \nOnce we have booked the appointment, we will send to you our \n\u201cLegal Report Pack\u201d.\n  This pack contains the documents that you will need to sign in the\npresence of our solicitor and without it the appointment cannot proceed.   \nIf you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us.\n \nCompletion\nWe will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the Lender to seek your authorisation to complete. As the action rests with More 2 Life\u2019s\nsolicitors to carry out their pre-completion checks we cannot give a precise time estimate.\nOur final bill and completion statement will be sent to you following completion.  We will pay your net funds directly into your bank account by BACS in\nthree days. If you wish to obtain your funds on the same day as completion we are able to offer a premium same day service if at an additional cost of \u00a340\n+VAT.  Please notify us if you do want to upgrade to the premium payment service and we will amend our records, but please note that funds are usually\nnot received from the lenders solicitors until mid-afternoon on the day of completion, such that same day transfer to you is not always possible. There are\ncertain parts of the transaction where we must use same day bank transfer, for example, paying off an existing charge and this is beyond our control."}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\n \nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\nIndemnity Insurance\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible."}

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\nmade.  Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for\nany errors or delays once the funds leave our account. Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due for\npayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \nShortfalls and Completion Funds\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)\nRegulation and limits on our services\nWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey\nreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the\nsuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance\nplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.  We can perform certain limited services in relation to\ninsurances and investments, provided they are closely linked with the legal services we are providing to you.  \nWe are not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) but we are included\non the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: LS 525526) so that we can carry on insurance mediation activity,\nwhich is broadly advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of our business, including arrangements for redress if\nsomething goes wrong, is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The register of exempt professional firms can be\naccessed via the Financial Conduct Authority website at: https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_Homepage\nThe Law Society of England and Wales is a designated professional body for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 but\nthe responsibility for regulation and complaints handling has been separated from the Law Society\u2019s representative functions.  The Solicitors\nRegulation Authority (SRA) is the independent professional regulator while the Legal Ombudsman handles complaints about lawyers.\nProfessional Indemnity Insurance and Limitation of Liability\nWe accept instructions from you on the basis that the work we do for you is provided by Equilaw Limited, trading as Equilaw. No advice given,\nor work undertaken is provided by any individual employee, Director or consultant of the company. You expressly agree that you will not\nbring any claim arising out of, or in connection with our engagement against any individual employee, Director or consultant of Equilaw\nLimited in their personal capacity.  Any duty of care that would otherwise, as a matter of law, be owed to you by any of our employees,\nDirectors or consultants is excluded from our contract with you.  However, this does not alter or reduce any liability which Equilaw Limited\nmay have to you and we will not seek to avoid any liability to you on the grounds that any relevant claim should have been brought against"}

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128500", "filename": "128500/22.pdf", "page_num": 6, "text": "FAQ\n1. \nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\r\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \r\nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\r\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\r\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\r\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\r\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\r\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\r\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\r\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \r\nYour Responsibilities\r\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\r\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\r\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\r\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \r\nOur Charges\r\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\r\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\r\non your behalf (disbursements).  \r\nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\r\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\r\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\r\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\r\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\r\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\r\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\r\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\r\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\r\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\r\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\r\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\r\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\r\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\r\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\r\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\r\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\r\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\r\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\r\n \r\nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\r\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\r\nIndemnity Insurance\r\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\r\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\r\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\r\nthe additional fees schedule.\r\nShortfall\r\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\r\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\r\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\r\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\r\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\r\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\r\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\r\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible."}

You are required to \r\nexplain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.  The provider \r\nwill not complete the transaction until they have received a Certificate which has been signed and completed by \r\nboth you and your client(s), whereby you confirm that you have drawn your client\u2019s(s\u2019) attention to the risks of \r\nentering into an equity release transaction and your client(s) confirms that he/they has/have been given the advice \r\nset out in the Certificate.\r\nGuidance on Independence \r\nClients must use a legal adviser who is independent of the provider\u2019s solicitor.  If you are advising a client in relation \r\nto an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent \r\nof the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013\r\n \r\n\u00b7 the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or \r\nWales); or\r\n\u00b7 the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\r\n\u00b7 the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of \r\nScotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which \r\ntake place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s \r\nRules & Guidance\r\nPayment of Fees \r\nWhilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to \r\nthis guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients \r\nto you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to \r\nyou.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not \r\nbe calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.\r\nThis also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected \r\nwith the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative \r\nor marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel \r\nmembership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of \r\nstaff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision \r\nor purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).  For the avoidance of doubt, certain \r\nmarketing payments which are not connected with payment on a case-by-case basis are permitted, subject to the \r\nregulatory obligations of the parties concerned. You must inform your client(s) in writing of the amount and \r\nfrequency of any financial arrangement, including marketing contributions, when issuing the customer case \r\ndocumentation at the outset.\r\nIf the customer chooses not to instruct their own legal adviser, the adviser or provider (as appropriate) may offer \r\nthe name of at least one local law firm which has knowledge of equity release products.  The adviser or provider \r\nmust ensure that no pressure or financial inducement is involved in directing customers to any particular law firm \r\neither by them or the intermediaries recommending their products.\r\nReceipt of Payments \r\nIf you are acting on behalf of the client you may not receive payments or other consideration from the adviser or \r\nprovider if that payment is dependent on the completion of an equity release transaction.

Interest  \n3.1 You will not be required to make any monthly payments during the term of the Loan Agreement. We will charge interest at the Interest Rate on the balance of the Amount Owed outstanding each day. Interest will accrue on the Amount Owed on a daily basis and we will \nadd the interest charged to the Amount Owed monthly on the day of each month numerically \ncorresponding with the date of loan completion (or the last day of the month where that day does not occur in any month) based upon a 365- day year or 366 days in any leap year. \nInterest wil l be charged on accrued interest. This means that as interest accumulates on the \nAmount Owed this interest is added each month to the Amount Owed itself and will also attract interest.  \n4.

Any amount expended will be added to the Amount Owed and secured under the Mortgage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, independent surveyors\u2019 fees incurred at any time on or following the Payment Date to establish whether insufficient money will arise from the sale of the Property to repay the Amount Owed).  \n4.5 Provided You have complied with the terms of the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage in all \nmaterial ways then, subject to paragraph 4.6, We will authorise a sale and accept the sale \nproceeds of the Property in full and final settlement of the Amount Owed even if such sale proceeds are insufficient to repay the full Amount Owed.  \n4.6 If We need to take action to repair the Property as a result of Your failure to keep the Property in good repair and as a result We incur Costs carrying out those repairs, paragraph 4.5 will not apply to that extent and You will be required to pay Us the Costs We have incurred.

What is a lifetime mortgage?\nImportant Information From The Financial Conduct Authority:\n\u2022A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life,\nand which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or\na regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the\nsale of your home after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death\nof the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries.\n\u2022If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or\nyou may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay the\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Any money left\nover belongs to you.\n\u2022If you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Again, any\nmoney left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs\nto move into long-term care, you don\u2019t usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either\ndies or moves into long-term care or another property.\n\u2022If you decide that you simply don\u2019t want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount\nyou owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do.\nSection 13 of this Offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage.\n\u2022Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment \u2013 this means you borrow a lump sum which is\ninvested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the full details of\nthe investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents\ntogether.\n4. What you have told us\n\u2022You want an Offer for the Flexi Choice plan.\n\u2022Your details: Male 83 years\nFemale 80 years\n\u2022Your property has been valued at: \u00a3795,000.00\n\u2022Construction: Standard\n\u2022You want a cash facility of \u00a3100,000.00.\n\u2022You want to receive an initial advance of \u00a350,000.00. No fees have been added to this amount, but\nthe fees you need to pay are shown in Section 11. For details of any insurance charges, see Section\n12.\n\u2022The remainder of your cash facility that is not drawn down at the start of your mortgage is subject to\na minimum draw down amount of \u00a32,000 each time (or the full amount of the remaining facility if\nless than \u00a32,000), and is also subject to the conditions described in Section 5.\n\u2022Changes to any of the information you have given us, could alter the information in this Offer.

Description of this mortgage\nThis Offer is for a Flexi Choice plan provided by more 2 life Limited. It provides you with a cash lump sum\nat the start of the loan and a cash facility which you may be able to draw cash from after your initial lump\nsum loan completion, subject to a minimum withdrawal of \u00a32,000 or withdrawal of the remaining facility\nif less than \u00a32,000. You do not have to make any payments during the life of this lifetime mortgage.\nYou can apply direct to more 2 life Limited for further borrowing of the remaining amount of this facility\nwithout further financial advice. This borrowing is not guaranteed and will be based on the terms available\nfrom more 2 life Limited at the time. The remaining cash facility will be reduced or removed:\n\u2022 If the product is no longer offered by the lender, the lender is no longer in business, Rothesay Life\nplc are no longer funding the lender, or to comply with the regulations governing either the lender\nor Rothesay Life plc\n\u2022 if, the total of (i) the amount outstanding under your lifetime mortgage (including your Initial Lump\nsum, any subsequent cash advances, accrued interest and any charges you have incurred) plus\n(ii) any unused part of your cash facility, exceeds the amount we would agree to lend to a new\nborrower (of equivalent age) in comparable circumstances. If the facility is fully withdrawn for this\nreason, you can repay your lifetime mortgage in full without incurring Early Repayment Charges\n\u2022 if any of the events of default specified in the Loan and Mortgage Conditions as causing the\nagreement to terminate and making the balance immediately due and payable has occurred or\nhave failed to maintain the property in good condition.\n\u2022if you are subject to an undischarged bankruptcy or individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) or have\nbeen discharged from bankruptcy or an IVA\n\u2022 If you own the property as tenants in common, where one applicant dies, the remaining borrower\ncannot access any unutilised cash facility when they are not the sole beneficiary of the deceased\u2019s\nshare of the property.\nAny such further borrowing will be based on the interest rate available from more 2 life Limited at the time\nof application for this product taking account of your then age and the value of your property relative to\nyour total outstanding balance and any unutilised cash facility. The interest rate applicable to such further\nborrowing may be more or less than your initial interest rate. The Offer that we give you at the time of any\ncash advance will set out the interest rate for that cash advance.\nThis lifetime mortgage can only be arranged for either one or two people between the ages of 55 - 84,\nbased on the age of the youngest applicant, who own and live permanently in the property which is\nsubject to the lifetime mortgage.\nIf there are any other outstanding mortgages or charges at the time the loan is taken out, you will be\nrequired to use the lifetime mortgage to clear these loans. As part of the completion process our solicitors\nwill redeem them with the proceeds from the loan.\nInterest is charged at a fixed rate of 6.62% on the initial advance until receipt by more 2 life Limited of all\nmonies due. The interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly, meaning the interest rolls up\nwith interest being charged on that interest, paid when you repay your loan. See Section 8 for example.\nAny cash advances will be subject to the new interest rate payable at the time which will be set out in\nthe Offer that we give you for that cash advance, and will be based on your then age and the value of\nyour property relative to your total outstanding balance and any unutilised cash facility, and which will\nthen be fixed for the lifetime of the loan.\nWe have based this Offer on an estimated term of 15 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime\nmortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 15 years. If you are still living in your home at\nthe end of 15 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run.\nThe loan, accrued interest and charges that may be due, become payable out of the proceeds from the\nsale of your home under the following circumstances;\n\u2022 On your death, or (if joint borrowers) on the death of the last borrower.\n\u2022 If you move home and transferring this lifetime mortgage to the new property does not meet our\nlending conditions.\n\u2022If you move into residential or long-term care on the grounds of medical or other specialist advice.\nAny money left over would be paid to you or your beneficiaries.\nThe maximum amount you can borrow is \u00a3318,000.00. however, if you change the loan amount currently\nrequested, the rate of interest may also change. If you require additional funds you may apply for further\nsecured borrowing subject to availability - see Section 14 for details.\nFC v1.30 1121 Page 4 of 15"}

If you are still living in your\nown home at the end of this term, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run and the amount you owe\nwill continue to increase.\n2. more 2 life Limited has the right to take legal action to repossess your house in the following\ncircumstances:\n(a) the property not being sold within 12 months of your death (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the\ndeath of the last borrower) or your entering long-term care (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the last\nborrower entering long-term care) or otherwise vacating the property; (b) compulsory purchase or\nrequisition of all or any part of the property; (c) false information or omission in information given to more\n2 life Limited, including fraud or money laundering; (d) any failure to notify and co-operate with more 2\nlife Limited in relation to an environmental notice issued under the provisions of the Environmental\nProtection Act 1990 or the Water Resources Act 1991 relating to your property or a neighbouring property;\n(e) you use or permit the property to be used otherwise than solely as a private residence; (f) you are or\nbecome bankrupt or enter into a composition or other arrangement with any of your creditors or you have\nbeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been engaged in criminal activity; or (g) you\nare in default under the mortgage conditions.\n3. If negative equity arises, this will be dealt with under the no Negative Equity Guarantee as set out in\nSection 6. If your home is sold for more than the outstanding lifetime mortgage balance, which includes\ninterest, any unpaid charges and costs, you or your estate will receive the difference.\n4. If you move home and want to transfer this lifetime mortgage to the new property, you can do so if the\nnew property meets our lending criteria. You will have to pay a Valuation Fee, Arrangement Fee and our\nand your legal expenses in respect of the new property. If the new property is of a lower value, we may\nask you to repay part of the amount outstanding on the lifetime mortgage.\n5. If you move out of your home into long-term care or residential care your home must be sold and the\nlifetime mortgage repaid. Early repayment charges do not apply if this happens - they are only payable\nif you choose to repay your lifetime mortgage early. Section 13 of this Offer tells you when they are\npayable.\n6. If you want someone else to move into your home to live with you, for example; upon marriage/the\nformation of a civil partnership, or where someone acts as your carer, you must first get more 2 life Limited\nto agree before they move in. Otherwise this will breach the terms of your mortgage. Any persons that\nare currently residing at the property and are not party to the loan may have to sign a waiver in order to\ncontinue living in the property.\n7. You must keep your home in good repair. If you do not keep your home in good repair, more 2 life\nLimited has the right to inspect the property and get the repairs done, but they will tell you first if they\nintend to do this. The cost of any repairs that more 2 life Limited has to arrange will be added to the amount\nyou owe on this lifetime mortgage. Where such costs are not able to be reclaimed on the sale of the\nproperty, they may be excluded from the no Negative Equity Guarantee (see Section 6).\n8. Taking out this mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits, and may also affect\nyour tax position. Tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need\nfurther advice you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, the Pension Service, Benefits Agency or your\nlocal Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau.\n9. The property must currently be mortgage free, or if there is a mortgage outstanding then this must be\neither repaid before or at the time the lifetime mortgage begins. You can use the funds released through\nthe lifetime mortgage to do this, but no second or subsequent mortgages over the property will be allowed\nat any time.\n10. Once the mortgage has been set up, you will not be able to add another person to it, even if your\ncircumstances change.\n11. You have an obligation to maintain buildings insurance on the property that the loan is secured against\nwhich must be adequate to cover the cost of rebuilding the property for that period of cover, and note\nour interest on the property in the policy.\n12. We may be willing to lend you more in the future, but we have no obligation to do so. Any further\nborrowing (including drawings of your remaining cash facility) will be based on the prevailing lending\ncriteria. The amount of your cash facility is not guaranteed and the facility will be reduced or withdrawn\nat any time, if the terms detailed in Section 5 are met.\nFC v1.30 1121 Page 6 of 15"}

You must sign the Legal Charge in front of a Solicitor, Chartered Legal\r\nExecutive, Licensed Conveyancer or Barrister (who should have a current practising certificate and professional indemnity insurance).  For\r\nconvenience, all will be referred to as \u201cSolicitor\u201d for the purposes of this statement.\r\nI\r\nOf\r\nMAKE THIS STATEMENT OF TRUTH as follows:-\r\n1. \r\nI confirm I instructed Equilaw to act on my behalf in this matter and that I was told by Viva Retirement Solutions that I was free to\r\ninstruct a solicitor of my choice.\r\n2. \r\nI am fully satisfied that my solicitor has properly advised me on the nature effects and implications of my entering into the Equity\r\nRelease plan. \r\n3. \r\nI have read a copy of my solicitors Equity Release report dated 17/11/2022 and I am satisfied with the contents therein and fully\r\nunderstand the same. \r\n4. \r\nI am not suffering from any physical or mental condition that prevents me from understanding the advice I have had or will receive\r\nfrom my solicitor (\u201cEquilaw\u201d) or which precludes me from entering into the equity release contract. \r\n5. \r\nI am aware of the implications should I decide to participate in the \u201cHomes for Ukraine scheme\u201d and that I MUST inform my lender\r\nand obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If I fail to do so, I will immediately\r\nbreach the terms and conditions of my mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.\r\n If the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with me, they can pursue me for that loss.\r\n6. \r\nThe interest on this loan will roll-up (where I am not making any repayments) and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the\r\nloan could wipe out the whole of the value of my Property in due course. This means that I would not be able to leave my Property\r\nor any part of it to beneficiaries under my Will.\r\n7. \r\nI am not under any undue influence or external pressure from any other party (including my family members) to proceed with this\r\nequity release contract. \r\n8. \r\nI have been advised to seek independent expert legal and financial advice in relation to any gift or loan of money which I will make\r\nfrom the equity release contract. \r\n9. \r\nI am aware that the Equity Release plan is intended to run for the rest of my life or until the last owner occupier has passed away\r\nor gone into permanent residential care. Early repayment charges are usually repayable should I decide to repay the loan early or if\r\nI decide to sell the property and live elsewhere. The maximum charge payable in this case is \u00a35341.23 as set out in section 13 of\r\nthe mortgage offer. Accessing any further draw down will result in a higher charge being payable.\r\n10. \r\nI have been advised to discuss the equity release contract with my family and other beneficiaries and am aware that taking out the\r\nequity release plan will reduce the value of the assets we may wish to leave to others.\r\n11. \r\nI confirm that we have been advised that Equilaw must notify the Lender of any material change in circumstances that may prevent\r\nthe Equity Release from completing (for example (but not limited to) something affecting the applicant(s) such as deterioration in\r\nhealth, or something affecting the property such as boundary dispute).\r\nI am aware that Equilaw must be notified as soon as reasonably possible should my circumstances change.\r\n12. \r\nI am aware that the lender does have the right after I or the last owner occupier dies or moves into permanent residential care to"}

Your offer was issued on 10/11/2022 and is valid for 42 days from that date.  In order to accept your\r\noffer, the signed mortgage documents must be with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors no later than 5 working days prior to the expiry date.

If the mortgage re-offer is at a higher rate of\r\ninterest this will increase the amount paid over the lifetime of the loan or, if you are servicing the interest payments, these will rise and you should ensure\r\nthat this is affordable.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128500", "filename": "128500/39.pdf", "page_num": 4, "text": "    \nThe objective of this report is to identify the key elements of your selected equity release mortgage plan, to advise you of your legal\nobligations and the effect of the equity release mortgage on you and the Property.\nIn term of suitability for your needs, you must rely entirely on the financial advice and guidance provided by your financial adviser or the\nplan provider\u2019s representative.  Equilaw cannot give you any financial advice regarding the plan\u2019s suitability for your circumstances and\nrequirements, now or in the future.  If you are not absolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your\nfinancial adviser before proceeding further.\nIf you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you have sought further financial\nadvice, from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment may not exceed the interest charged on this product.  \nAny existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the Property must be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release.  If you do\nnot intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding further.  Unless we hear from you to\nthe contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity\nrelease funds paid to you on completion. \nAdditionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the\nequity release.  The effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against your home.  Please ensure that you have\nreviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances.  If this applies in\nyour case, you will find details in the \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d section of this report.\nYou may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance\ntax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees.  The rules and regulations relating\nto gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. The equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose,\nwithout careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. \nPlease also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life.\n Further information and guidance is produced by Age UK and can be found at \nwww.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information-\nguides-and-factsheets/\n.\nIt is important to review and/or make a Will in the context of taking out an equity release plan.  Making a Will can achieve significant\nsavings in tax and costs of winding up your estate.  It also means that your assets will be distributed in accordance with your wishes and\nnot as provided for by the general laws of intestacy.  You should also consider making a Lasting Power of Attorney, which can safeguard\nyour position and ensure that your wishes are carried out in relation to the Property, health and finances in the event that you become\nincapable of handling these decisions personally in the future.  If you would like to discuss these matters please let me know and I will\nput you in touch with an appropriate specialist.\nYou should read this report, together with the Mortgage Deed, the Loan Agreement and the More 2 Life Mortgage Terms and Conditions\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Conditions\") before committing to the scheme.  \nIf there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact Natasha Wakefield or your financial adviser \nbefore you\nproceed. You should not go ahead with the scheme until you are satisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy with it.\nFraud Warning\nWe will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional corroboration or security\nmeasures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly. If you receive any telephone call or email\nmessage that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us\nimmediately using our main office telephone number which can be found on our letterhead. \n4"}

What is the Equity Release Scheme?\n1.1\nProduct Type\nFollowing advice from your financial adviser, , More 2 Life - Flexi Choice Lump Sum Lifetime Mortgage - Lifetime General Loan\nConditions and Mortgage Conditions (2019 Ed.) has been selected as the most suitable product for your requirements.  This\nis a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home.\n1.2\nAmount of Loan\nThe maximum amount that More 2 Life are willing to lend is \u00a3318,000.00. At the date of completion, you will receive a lump\nsum of \u00a350,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). You will also have access to a cash\nfacility of \u00a350,000.00.\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the Property as security for this loan.\nYou can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More 2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the\nrequest in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request.\n1.3\nCash Facility\nFollowing completion, you will have access to a Cash Facility of \u00a350,000.00.\nYou will not be charged interest on the Cash Facility until you draw funds from it.  When you do withdraw funds, More 2 Life\nwill charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher OR lower than the original rate in this offer of\n6.62%.  Please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the Cash\nFacility.  \nYou can apply at any time, to More 2 Life to borrow any amount within your Cash Facility subject to a minimum amount of\n\u00a32,000.00.  \nPlease note that More 2 Life does have the right to withdraw the Cash Facility at any time, as set out in section 5 of the Offer.\n1.4\nInterest\nThe interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 6.62%.  Interest is calculated daily and\nadded to the loan monthly. \nYou are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. Unpaid interest will be added to\nthe loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (\u201crolling up\u201d). The interest continues to roll up,\nat the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid.   Over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any\nperiodic voluntary repayments).  If house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the Property will be\neroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the Property. \nThe requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the Property has been abandoned. This will either be because you have\ndied, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the Property. Please note that interest continues to roll up until\nthe mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the Property); it will not stop just because you are no\nlonger living there.\nSection 8 of the Offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. The loan period\nmay be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest\nwhich accrues.\nThe Annual Percentage Rate is 7%.\n1.5\nInheritance Protection\nMore 2 Life offers inheritance protection.  This allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the Property, but\nultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow.  You have opted not to protect any of the equity in The Property.  \nPlease note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to\nopt for Inheritance Protection will have been lost.  If you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would\nlike to protect a proportion of the Property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to\ncompletion.\n5"}
{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128500", "filename": "128500/39.pdf", "page_num": 6, "text": "1.6\nNo Negative Equity Guarantee.\nMore 2 Life provides a \u201cno negative equity\u201d guarantee.  This means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or\nyour estate owe more than the value of your home, More 2 Life will not seek to recover any further amount than the\nproceeds of sale.  \nThis guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the Terms and Conditions of the plan.  For example, keeping\nthe Property in good repair and condition.  The guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by\nMore 2 Life. \nThe guarantee only applies when the Property is sold to repay the loan.  It will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the\nProperty and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your Property will reduce the\navailable equity for a new Property. \nAll of the lenders that belong to the Equity Release Council offer a \u201cno-negative equity guarantee\u201d which means that if the\nlevel of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any\nshortfall. However, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee.  This is not\nspecified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so I cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything).  The downside is\nthat if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not\nneed.  However, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable.  There is not\ncurrently an \u201cEquity Release Council approved\u201d product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which\nmeets Council standards, there is no alternative.  If you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your\nfinancial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you.\n1.7\nOnce the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of\nthe loan you are taking, versus the value of your Property.\nCompound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future).\n1.8\nMoving House\nIt is possible to move to a different Property, under the terms of the scheme (please see More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions)\nprovided that the Property you want to move to is acceptable to More 2 Life.  However, this is not guaranteed.  Examples of\nwhere More 2 Life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another Property might include a flat, where the lease does not\nhave enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the Property is of non-standard construction.\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to \u201cporting\u201d your mortgage to a new Property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than\nyour current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan.  No early repayment charges will apply in these\ncircumstances. If you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve More 2 Life from\nthe outset.  The solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors at all stages to ensure that\nMore 2 Life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend.  Only once More 2 Life have\nconfirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to\nexchange.  You must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new\nproperty without More 2 Life\u2019s consent.\nIf your proposed new Property is not acceptable to More 2 Life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract\nan early repayment charge.\nIf your proposed new home does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early\nrepayment charge will apply. Furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower\ndying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge.\nYou should always obtain More 2 Life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in\nthe event that this is not possible\n1.9\nSale of Part of your Property \nIf you are seeking to sell part of your Property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell More 2 Life and seek More 2\nLife\u2019s prior consent.  If the sale of part of your Property reduces the value of your Property you may be required to repay\nsome of the loan. \nNo early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances.\n1.10\nTaxation on the Loan\nThe loan is tax-free under present legislation. \n6"}

Your obligations and what you have agreed to do \n3.1\nBorrowing\nYou have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. Any existing mortgage you may have) out of the equity release funds and\ncannot use your home as security for any further borrowing, unless More 2 Life gives its written permission.\n3.2\nWho can live in the Property?\nOnly the people named in the mortgage offer are allowed to live at the Property. \n3.3\nMoving a new person into the Property\nIf you want somebody else to move into your home, you must seek More 2 Life\u2019s authority to do so.  The new occupier will\nbe required to sign the Lender's Occupier's Waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be\nresponsible for the legal fees) before they move in.\nIf you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan\nin the name of the proposed joint owners.\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to\nrepay part of the loan (without early repayment charge).\n3.4\nResidence\nThis must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. If you are planning to\nleave your Property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform More 2 Life of your intention, and seek its permission to\ndo so.  \nIt is important that you do this so that More 2 Life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance\nwith its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the Property and repayment of the loan, potentially\nincurring early redemption charges.  \nYou must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the Property.  Usually this is a\nrequirement if you are planning to leave the Property empty for 30 days or more.\n3.5\nYou can live in the Property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage\nconditions).  Please carefully read More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions\n(including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the Terms and Conditions). \n3.6\nRight to Inspect the Property\nMore 2 Life is entitled to inspect the Property periodically to ensure that the Terms and Conditions of the loan are being\ncomplied with.  More 2 Life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of\nemergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse.  This is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is\nset out at Section 10 in the Terms and Conditions.\n3.7\nRepair & Maintenance\nYou have agreed to keep the Property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting\nit fall into disrepair.\nIf More 2 Life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done\nwithin the time stipulated or More 2 Life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it.\n If you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage\nand interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up.\nPlease also note that if you do not keep the Property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out\nthe repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee.\n3.8\nInsurance\nYou must keep the Property fully insured, by a company approved by More 2 Life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to\n9"}

The reinstatement sum insured as assessed by More 2 Lifes valuer\nand must be no less than \u00a3400,000.00.\nWe will require sight of the new insurance policy prior to completion, to enable us to demonstrate that it meets More 2 Life\u2019s\nrequirements.\nMore 2 Life should be noted on your buildings insurance as per the Terms and Conditions and you may need to send More 2\nLife a copy of your buildings insurance each year, so that they can check that you have the necessary insurance cover.  If the\nlevel of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. A copy\nwill be required for completion, please send to us, if not already done so.\nIf you do not insure your Property More 2 Life will do this for you but will re-charge you for the cost of the insurance to you.\nYou must pay these sums once notified, should you fail to do so More 2 Life will charge interest on the amount outstanding.\n These costs will fall outside of the no negative equity guarantee. You should also note that any insurance arranged by More\n2 Life will be suitable for More 2 Life\u2019s purposes but many not be suitable for you.  We recommend that you always source\nyour own index linked insurance.\nIf an insurable event e.g. a fire, occurs you must immediately inform More 2 Life.  Any monies paid under the insurance\npolicy to you must be used to repair and make good the loss and damage or repay the total debt owing.\n3.9\nImpact on your Estate\nYou should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate\nwhich you are able to leave to them on your death. It is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate,\nincluding the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the Property to move into long term\ncare.  They will need to notify More 2 Life of this event and be aware of More 2 Life\u2019s requirements regarding repayment of\nthe loan.\n3.10\nLegal Notice, Orders or Proposals effecting your Property.\nYou must inform More 2 Life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the Property.\n3.11\nAlterations to the Property\nYou must seek More 2 Life\u2019s permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the Property (e.g., new\nbasement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations\napproval)  This is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for\nplanning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from More 2 Life in principle\nas, if the lender refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work.  Lenders do not usually withhold consent\nunreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and\nbasements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects.\nIf you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as Green Deal) you must first obtain\nthe written permission of More 2 Life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the Property, which is not allowed by\nMore 2 Life).\n3.12\nAcquiring additional land adjoining the Property\nIf you buy or acquire any land next to the Property please notify More 2 Life.  More 2 Life may require you to extend the\nmortgage to cover include this piece of land.  This is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the\nProperty (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. Please see More\n2 Lifes Terms and Conditions.\n3.13\nRenting out the Property\nYou cannot rent out the Property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself.  If you wish to do so, please contact More 2 Life.\nIf More 2 Life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a \u201cBuy to Let\u201d loan.  Your financial adviser will be\nable to assist you.\n3.14\nBusiness Use\nYou cannot use your home for business purposes.  If you wish to do so you must contact More 2 Life to seek its permission.\n10"}

When does the loan have to be repaid? \n4.1\nThe loan contract ends when: \nThe last owner of the Property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or\nresidential nursing care according to the definition of \u201ccare\u201d in the Terms and Conditions, which you should read\ncarefully); or\nIf you purchase another Property and the loan cannot be ported; or\nthe Property is permanently abandoned; or\nIf you become bankrupt; or\nIf you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the Terms and Conditions.\nThe amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by More 2 Life (for\nexample repair costs). \nThe term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 15 years.  This does not mean the mortgage\ncomes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase.\n4.2\nImpact of Loan ending due to Death or Long Term Care \nIf the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then More 2 Life may request medical or other specialist evidence\nof the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused.\nNo early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the\nloan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\nThe term will also end on death. No early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will\ncontinue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\n4.3\nSale of the Property \nYou or your Attorney (if you have appointed one under a Power of Attorney) or Personal Representatives (if you have died)\nwill have a maximum of 12 months to sell the Property.  If the Property is not sold within 12 months More 2 Life may take\nover conduct of the sale.  This would usually be if More 2 Life perceived no progress was being made and that this was\nunreasonable in the circumstances.\nBy signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint More 2 Life under a Power of\nAttorney in relation to the Property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. That said, if you are still capable of\ndealing with your own affairs, or have your own Attorney, More 2 Life would not usually get involved. \nHowever, it does mean that More 2 Life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the\nProperty, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the Property at the\nend of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so.\n4.4\nBankruptcy and/or Breach of Material Contract Terms \nThe loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the Terms and Conditions,\nspecifically your obligations as set out in the Terms and Conditions. Please note that early repayment charges are applicable\nin these circumstances.\n4.5\nEarly Repayment Charges. \nEarly repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the Terms and Conditions.\nIt is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time. However, if you chose to do this prior to the 15 year early\nredemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge.\nThe early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date:\nup to the 1st anniversary the charge is 10% of the amount repaid;\nup to the 2nd anniversary the charge is 9% of the amount repaid;\nup to the 3rd anniversary the charge is 8% of the amount repaid;\nup to the 4th anniversary the charge is 7% of the amount repaid;\nup to the 5th anniversary the charge is 6% of the amount repaid;\n12"}

It is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at\nany time. However, if you chose to do this you may incur an early repayment charge.\nIf you wish to repay your loan early, we suggest contacting More 2 Life for a redemption statement.\n4.6\nExemption from Early Repayment Charges\nNo early repayment charge will be made if:\nyou or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies;\nafter 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your new property does not meet\nMore 2 Life's lending criteria;\nthe total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage to the Property;\nyou make a voluntary partial repayment;\nthe lifetime mortgage is repaid by remaining borrower within 3 years of the death or requirement for long term care of\nfirst borrower;\nthe cash faciity is withdrawn; or\nyou downsize to a lower value Property and are requested to make a partial repayment.\n4.7\nVoluntary Partial Early Repayments\nMore 2 Life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge provided:\nThe total amount of voluntary payments does not exceed 10% of the total cash advanced per annum;\nMinimum payment of \u00a350, unlimited instalments.\nPlease note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, the early repayment charge will attach.

What are the disadvantages?\n6.1\nMeans-tested State benefits, such as Pension Credit or Council Tax benefits may be affected.  You should therefore check\nyour entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. \n6.2\nThe loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in your home over time, where no voluntary\nrepayments are made, particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the\nvalue of your home.\n6.3\nFurther loans against the Property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by\nMore 2 Life while its loan is still in existence.  A further advance from More 2 Life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your\nindividual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in your Property.  \n6.4\nIf you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt the Property can be repossessed and the no negative equity\nguarantee may be revoked.\n6.5\nThis is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the Property\nis repossessed). For your peace of mind, More 2 Life have set a maximum figure which can be charged of \u00a35,341.23, this\nallows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging.\nThe calculation of the charges is as set out in Section 13 of the Offer.\n15"}

Conclusions: Risk -v- Reward\nIt is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the\nrisks of entering into this agreement.\nRisk\n7.1\nIf you seriously breach the Terms and Conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the Property could be repossessed and sold to\nrepay the loan.  This may incur early repayment charges.  If you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity\nguarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by More 2 Life as a result of the breaches.\nMore 2 Life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach.\nRepossession would always be a matter of last resort.\n7.2\nIf you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances.\nFurther additional secured borrowing from More 2 Life is not guaranteed. \n7.3\nIf you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you\nwished to re-mortgage with another lender.\n7.4\nIf the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump\nsum that you have taken. \n7.5\nIf you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of\nthe loan will erode the equity available in the Property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary\nrepayments) , particularly if the value of the Property does not go up over time.  This means that you would not be able to\nleave this Property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your Wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the\nProperty have been sold.\n7.6\nEligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. \n7.7\nAny existing charge secured against the Property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which\nwill reduce the amount you receive on completion.\n7.8\nIf your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt\nsecured against your home.  You should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the\nbest course of action for you.  \n \nReward:\n7.9\nYou will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use.\n7.10\nThere is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home\n(provided there are no breaches of the Terms and Conditions). \n7.11\nYou can potentially \u201cport\u201d this mortgage to a new Property if you want to move house.\n16"}

What happens next?\n8.1\nPlease read and consider this report carefully, together with the mortgage offer and the Terms and Conditions.  If you are\nwilling to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive to outweigh the Risks involved the next step is\nto arrange a signing appointment to complete the required documentation.  If you are still unsure, or we can clarify any\naspect for you, please do not hesitate to contact Natasha Wakefield.  \nYou should keep this report for future reference.\n8.2\nAppointment\n \nIn order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully.  It is a matter of law that\nthe deed MUST be executed in the physical presence of an independent person.  The Equity Release Council (\"ERC\")\nguidelines require this to be a solicitor.\n \nThe attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation and not to provide you\nwith any legal advice.  Legal advice is provided by us within this \u201cMortgage Report\u201d.  If you have any questions or queries\narising from this report, please direct these to Natasha Wakefield in advance of the appointment. \nIn preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed Document Checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are\navailable.  If any documents are missing, please contact Natasha Wakefield prior to the appointment so we can arrange for\nany replacement documents to be sent to you in readiness.  If the missing documents are those in your care and control, but\nare unavailable, please contact Natasha Wakefield so that we can discuss how best to proceed.\nWe anticipate that the Solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. Please note that only the equity release\napplicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. The solicitor will need to verify your identity at the appointment\nand take copies of the documentation provided.  Please ensure you have:\n\u2022    Valid photographic signature identification: i.e Passport, Driving Licence, National Identity Card AND Address verification:\ni.e bank statement;\n\u2022    Utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current Council Tax Bill naming each borrower.\n\u2022    In order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your exact bank details\notherwise the banking system will reject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you.  In order to\nensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank statement showing the bank account name, sort code\nand account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment.\nVery occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing\nappointment.  To minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via Skype or Facetime.  If you are not able to access this via\nyour own (or a family/friends\u2019) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local\nsolicitor who will charge \u00a35 per document \u2018witnessing fee\u2019.   If this is required, we will notify you and provide our\nSkype/Facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. \n8.3\nCost of the Solicitor Appointment\nThe costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting.  If you cancel or fail\nto attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to\nbe met.  If you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency.  \n8.4\nIdentification\nWe must provide a \u201cguarantee\u201d of your identity to More 2 Life at the point of requesting completion.  To be able to give this\nguarantee we will need valid photographic Identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport.  If you do not have such identity\nverification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity.  \nPlease see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories.  Please contact\nNatasha Wakefield to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required\nguarantee.\nAdditionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly.  \nIf there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your\nbirth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). \nIf there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: Your most recent council tax invoice\nAND a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a DWP pensions letter.\n17"}

Equilaw cannot give you any financial advice regarding the plan\u2019s suitability for your circumstances and\nrequirements, now or in the future.  If you are not absolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your\nfinancial adviser before proceeding further.\nIf you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you have sought further financial\nadvice, from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment may not exceed the interest charged on this product.  \nAny existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the Property must be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release.  If you do\nnot intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding further.  Unless we hear from you to\nthe contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity\nrelease funds paid to you on completion. \nAdditionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the\nequity release.  The effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against your home.  Please ensure that you have\nreviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances.  If this applies in\nyour case, you will find details in the \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d section of this report.\nYou may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance\ntax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees.  The rules and regulations relating\nto gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. The equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose,\nwithout careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. \nPlease also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life.\n Further information and guidance is produced by Age UK and can be found at \nwww.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information-\nguides-and-factsheets/\n.\nIt is important to review and/or make a Will in the context of taking out an equity release plan.  Making a Will can achieve significant\nsavings in tax and costs of winding up your estate.

What is the Equity Release Scheme?\n1.1\nProduct Type\nFollowing advice from your financial adviser, , More 2 Life - Flexi Choice Lump Sum Lifetime Mortgage - Lifetime General Loan\nConditions and Mortgage Conditions (2019 Ed.) has been selected as the most suitable product for your requirements.  This\nis a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home.\n1.2\nAmount of Loan\nThe maximum amount that More 2 Life are willing to lend is \u00a3318,000.00. At the date of completion, you will receive a lump\nsum of \u00a350,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). You will also have access to a cash\nfacility of \u00a350,000.00.\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the Property as security for this loan.\nYou can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More 2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the\nrequest in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request.\n1.3\nCash Facility\nFollowing completion, you will have access to a Cash Facility of \u00a350,000.00.\nYou will not be charged interest on the Cash Facility until you draw funds from it.  When you do withdraw funds, More 2 Life\nwill charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher OR lower than the original rate in this offer of\n6.62%.  Please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the Cash\nFacility.  \nYou can apply at any time, to More 2 Life to borrow any amount within your Cash Facility subject to a minimum amount of\n\u00a32,000.00.  \nPlease note that More 2 Life does have the right to withdraw the Cash Facility at any time, as set out in section 5 of the Offer.\n1.4\nInterest\nThe interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 6.62%.  Interest is calculated daily and\nadded to the loan monthly. \nYou are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. Unpaid interest will be added to\nthe loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (\u201crolling up\u201d). The interest continues to roll up,\nat the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid.   Over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any\nperiodic voluntary repayments).  If house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the Property will be\neroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the Property. \nThe requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the Property has been abandoned. This will either be because you have\ndied, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the Property. Please note that interest continues to roll up until\nthe mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the Property); it will not stop just because you are no\nlonger living there.\nSection 8 of the Offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. The loan period\nmay be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest\nwhich accrues.\nThe Annual Percentage Rate is 7%.\n1.5\nInheritance Protection\nMore 2 Life offers inheritance protection.  This allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the Property, but\nultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow.  You have opted not to protect any of the equity in The Property.  \nPlease note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to\nopt for Inheritance Protection will have been lost.  If you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would\nlike to protect a proportion of the Property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to\ncompletion."}
{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128500", "filename": "128500/40.pdf", "page_num": 4, "text": "1.6\nNo Negative Equity Guarantee.\nMore 2 Life provides a \u201cno negative equity\u201d guarantee.  This means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or\nyour estate owe more than the value of your home, More 2 Life will not seek to recover any further amount than the\nproceeds of sale.  \nThis guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the Terms and Conditions of the plan.  For example, keeping\nthe Property in good repair and condition.  The guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by\nMore 2 Life. \nThe guarantee only applies when the Property is sold to repay the loan.  It will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the\nProperty and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your Property will reduce the\navailable equity for a new Property. \nAll of the lenders that belong to the Equity Release Council offer a \u201cno-negative equity guarantee\u201d which means that if the\nlevel of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any\nshortfall. However, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee.  This is not\nspecified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so I cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything).  The downside is\nthat if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not\nneed.  However, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable.  There is not\ncurrently an \u201cEquity Release Council approved\u201d product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which\nmeets Council standards, there is no alternative.  If you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your\nfinancial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you.\n1.7\nOnce the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of\nthe loan you are taking, versus the value of your Property.\nCompound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future).\n1.8\nMoving House\nIt is possible to move to a different Property, under the terms of the scheme (please see More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions)\nprovided that the Property you want to move to is acceptable to More 2 Life.  However, this is not guaranteed.  Examples of\nwhere More 2 Life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another Property might include a flat, where the lease does not\nhave enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the Property is of non-standard construction.\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to \u201cporting\u201d your mortgage to a new Property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than\nyour current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan.  No early repayment charges will apply in these\ncircumstances. If you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve More 2 Life from\nthe outset.  The solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors at all stages to ensure that\nMore 2 Life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend.  Only once More 2 Life have\nconfirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to\nexchange.  You must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new\nproperty without More 2 Life\u2019s consent.\nIf your proposed new Property is not acceptable to More 2 Life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract\nan early repayment charge.\nIf your proposed new home does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early\nrepayment charge will apply. Furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower\ndying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge.\nYou should always obtain More 2 Life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in\nthe event that this is not possible\n1.9\nSale of Part of your Property \nIf you are seeking to sell part of your Property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell More 2 Life and seek More 2\nLife\u2019s prior consent.  If the sale of part of your Property reduces the value of your Property you may be required to repay\nsome of the loan. \nNo early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances.\n1.10\nTaxation on the Loan\nThe loan is tax-free under present legislation.

Your obligations and what you have agreed to do \n3.1\nBorrowing\nYou have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. Any existing mortgage you may have) out of the equity release funds and\ncannot use your home as security for any further borrowing, unless More 2 Life gives its written permission.\n3.2\nWho can live in the Property?\nOnly the people named in the mortgage offer are allowed to live at the Property. \n3.3\nMoving a new person into the Property\nIf you want somebody else to move into your home, you must seek More 2 Life\u2019s authority to do so.  The new occupier will\nbe required to sign the Lender's Occupier's Waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be\nresponsible for the legal fees) before they move in.\nIf you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan\nin the name of the proposed joint owners.\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to\nrepay part of the loan (without early repayment charge).\n3.4\nResidence\nThis must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. If you are planning to\nleave your Property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform More 2 Life of your intention, and seek its permission to\ndo so.  \nIt is important that you do this so that More 2 Life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance\nwith its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the Property and repayment of the loan, potentially\nincurring early redemption charges.  \nYou must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the Property.  Usually this is a\nrequirement if you are planning to leave the Property empty for 30 days or more.\n3.5\nYou can live in the Property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage\nconditions).  Please carefully read More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions\n(including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the Terms and Conditions). \n3.6\nRight to Inspect the Property\nMore 2 Life is entitled to inspect the Property periodically to ensure that the Terms and Conditions of the loan are being\ncomplied with.  More 2 Life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of\nemergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse.  This is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is\nset out at Section 10 in the Terms and Conditions.\n3.7\nRepair & Maintenance\nYou have agreed to keep the Property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting\nit fall into disrepair.\nIf More 2 Life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done\nwithin the time stipulated or More 2 Life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it.\n If you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage\nand interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up.\nPlease also note that if you do not keep the Property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out\nthe repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee.\n3.8\nInsurance\nYou must keep the Property fully insured, by a company approved by More 2 Life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to"}

You should also note that any insurance arranged by More\n2 Life will be suitable for More 2 Life\u2019s purposes but many not be suitable for you.  We recommend that you always source\nyour own index linked insurance.\nIf an insurable event e.g. a fire, occurs you must immediately inform More 2 Life.  Any monies paid under the insurance\npolicy to you must be used to repair and make good the loss and damage or repay the total debt owing.\n3.9\nImpact on your Estate\nYou should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate\nwhich you are able to leave to them on your death. It is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate,\nincluding the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the Property to move into long term\ncare.  They will need to notify More 2 Life of this event and be aware of More 2 Life\u2019s requirements regarding repayment of\nthe loan.\n3.10\nLegal Notice, Orders or Proposals effecting your Property.\nYou must inform More 2 Life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the Property.\n3.11\nAlterations to the Property\nYou must seek More 2 Life\u2019s permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the Property (e.g., new\nbasement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations\napproval)  This is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for\nplanning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from More 2 Life in principle\nas, if the lender refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work.  Lenders do not usually withhold consent\nunreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and\nbasements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects.\nIf you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as Green Deal) you must first obtain\nthe written permission of More 2 Life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the Property, which is not allowed by\nMore 2 Life).\n3.12\nAcquiring additional land adjoining the Property\nIf you buy or acquire any land next to the Property please notify More 2 Life.  More 2 Life may require you to extend the\nmortgage to cover include this piece of land.  This is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the\nProperty (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. Please see More\n2 Lifes Terms and Conditions.\n3.13\nRenting out the Property\nYou cannot rent out the Property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself.  If you wish to do so, please contact More 2 Life.\nIf More 2 Life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a \u201cBuy to Let\u201d loan.  Your financial adviser will be\nable to assist you.\n3.14\nBusiness Use\nYou cannot use your home for business purposes.  If you wish to do so you must contact More 2 Life to seek its permission."}

When does the loan have to be repaid? \n4.1\nThe loan contract ends when: \nThe last owner of the Property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or\nresidential nursing care according to the definition of \u201ccare\u201d in the Terms and Conditions, which you should read\ncarefully); or\nIf you purchase another Property and the loan cannot be ported; or\nthe Property is permanently abandoned; or\nIf you become bankrupt; or\nIf you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the Terms and Conditions.\nThe amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by More 2 Life (for\nexample repair costs). \nThe term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 15 years.  This does not mean the mortgage\ncomes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase.\n4.2\nImpact of Loan ending due to Death or Long Term Care \nIf the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then More 2 Life may request medical or other specialist evidence\nof the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused.\nNo early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the\nloan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\nThe term will also end on death. No early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will\ncontinue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\n4.3\nSale of the Property \nYou or your Attorney (if you have appointed one under a Power of Attorney) or Personal Representatives (if you have died)\nwill have a maximum of 12 months to sell the Property.  If the Property is not sold within 12 months More 2 Life may take\nover conduct of the sale.  This would usually be if More 2 Life perceived no progress was being made and that this was\nunreasonable in the circumstances.\nBy signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint More 2 Life under a Power of\nAttorney in relation to the Property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. That said, if you are still capable of\ndealing with your own affairs, or have your own Attorney, More 2 Life would not usually get involved. \nHowever, it does mean that More 2 Life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the\nProperty, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the Property at the\nend of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so.\n4.4\nBankruptcy and/or Breach of Material Contract Terms \nThe loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the Terms and Conditions,\nspecifically your obligations as set out in the Terms and Conditions. Please note that early repayment charges are applicable\nin these circumstances.\n4.5\nEarly Repayment Charges. \nEarly repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the Terms and Conditions.\nIt is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time.

Conclusions: Risk -v- Reward\nIt is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the\nrisks of entering into this agreement.\nRisk\n7.1\nIf you seriously breach the Terms and Conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the Property could be repossessed and sold to\nrepay the loan.  This may incur early repayment charges.  If you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity\nguarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by More 2 Life as a result of the breaches.\nMore 2 Life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach.\nRepossession would always be a matter of last resort.\n7.2\nIf you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances.\nFurther additional secured borrowing from More 2 Life is not guaranteed. \n7.3\nIf you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you\nwished to re-mortgage with another lender.\n7.4\nIf the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump\nsum that you have taken. \n7.5\nIf you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of\nthe loan will erode the equity available in the Property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary\nrepayments) , particularly if the value of the Property does not go up over time.  This means that you would not be able to\nleave this Property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your Wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the\nProperty have been sold.\n7.6\nEligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. \n7.7\nAny existing charge secured against the Property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which\nwill reduce the amount you receive on completion.\n7.8\nIf your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt\nsecured against your home.  You should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the\nbest course of action for you.  \n \nReward:\n7.9\nYou will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use.\n7.10\nThere is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home\n(provided there are no breaches of the Terms and Conditions). \n7.11\nYou can potentially \u201cport\u201d this mortgage to a new Property if you want to move house."}

What happens next?\n8.1\nPlease read and consider this report carefully, together with the mortgage offer and the Terms and Conditions.  If you are\nwilling to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive to outweigh the Risks involved the next step is\nto arrange a signing appointment to complete the required documentation.  If you are still unsure, or we can clarify any\naspect for you, please do not hesitate to contact Natasha Wakefield.  \nYou should keep this report for future reference.\n8.2\nAppointment\n \nIn order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully.  It is a matter of law that\nthe deed MUST be executed in the physical presence of an independent person.  The Equity Release Council (\"ERC\")\nguidelines require this to be a solicitor.\n \nThe attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation and not to provide you\nwith any legal advice.  Legal advice is provided by us within this \u201cMortgage Report\u201d.  If you have any questions or queries\narising from this report, please direct these to Natasha Wakefield in advance of the appointment. \nIn preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed Document Checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are\navailable.  If any documents are missing, please contact Natasha Wakefield prior to the appointment so we can arrange for\nany replacement documents to be sent to you in readiness.  If the missing documents are those in your care and control, but\nare unavailable, please contact Natasha Wakefield so that we can discuss how best to proceed.\nWe anticipate that the Solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. Please note that only the equity release\napplicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. The solicitor will need to verify your identity at the appointment\nand take copies of the documentation provided.  Please ensure you have:\n\u2022    Valid photographic signature identification: i.e Passport, Driving Licence, National Identity Card AND Address verification:\ni.e bank statement;\n\u2022    Utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current Council Tax Bill naming each borrower.\n\u2022    In order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your exact bank details\notherwise the banking system will reject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you.  In order to\nensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent bank statement showing the bank account name, sort code\nand account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment.\nVery occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing\nappointment.  To minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via Skype or Facetime.  If you are not able to access this via\nyour own (or a family/friends\u2019) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local\nsolicitor who will charge \u00a35 per document \u2018witnessing fee\u2019.   If this is required, we will notify you and provide our\nSkype/Facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. \n8.3\nCost of the Solicitor Appointment\nThe costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting.  If you cancel or fail\nto attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to\nbe met.  If you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency.  \n8.4\nIdentification\nWe must provide a \u201cguarantee\u201d of your identity to More 2 Life at the point of requesting completion.  To be able to give this\nguarantee we will need valid photographic Identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport.  If you do not have such identity\nverification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity.  \nPlease see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories.  Please contact\nNatasha Wakefield to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required\nguarantee.\nAdditionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly.  \nIf there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your\nbirth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). \nIf there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: Your most recent council tax invoice\nAND a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a DWP pensions letter."}

Sometimes funds are not received until late afternoon\nand, in such circumstances, we may not be able to process the funds within banking hours.  We will always process your\nfunds on the next working day when we receive funds too late to process on the same day.\n  \nPlease contact Natasha Wakefield if the funds are not in your account within 48 hours (working days) of completion taking\nplace.\n \nPlease ensure that you have read and understand all sections of your mortgage report and mortgage offer. If you have any queries\nregarding any aspects of your equity release please do not hesitate to contact your case handler Natasha Wakefield. We will not\nproceed to completion with the equity release until you are happy with all of the Terms and Conditions outlined above. "}

What is a lifetime mortgage?\nImportant Information From The Financial Conduct Authority:\n\u2022A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life,\nand which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or\na regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the\nsale of your home after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death\nof the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries.\n\u2022If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or\nyou may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay the\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Any money left\nover belongs to you.\n\u2022If you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Again, any\nmoney left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs\nto move into long-term care, you don\u2019t usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either\ndies or moves into long-term care or another property.\n\u2022If you decide that you simply don\u2019t want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount\nyou owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do.\nSection 13 of this Offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage.\n\u2022Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment \u2013 this means you borrow a lump sum which is\ninvested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the full details of\nthe investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents\ntogether.\n4. What you have told us\n\u2022You want an Offer for the Flexi Choice plan.\n\u2022Your details: Male 83 years\nFemale 80 years\n\u2022Your property has been valued at: \u00a3795,000.00\n\u2022Construction: Standard\n\u2022You want a cash facility of \u00a3100,000.00.\n\u2022You want to receive an initial advance of \u00a350,000.00. No fees have been added to this amount, but\nthe fees you need to pay are shown in Section 11. For details of any insurance charges, see Section\n12.\n\u2022The remainder of your cash facility that is not drawn down at the start of your mortgage is subject to\na minimum draw down amount of \u00a32,000 each time (or the full amount of the remaining facility if\nless than \u00a32,000), and is also subject to the conditions described in Section 5.\n\u2022Changes to any of the information you have given us, could alter the information in this Offer.

Description of this mortgage\nThis Offer is for a Flexi Choice plan provided by more 2 life Limited. It provides you with a cash lump sum\nat the start of the loan and a cash facility which you may be able to draw cash from after your initial lump\nsum loan completion, subject to a minimum withdrawal of \u00a32,000 or withdrawal of the remaining facility\nif less than \u00a32,000. You do not have to make any payments during the life of this lifetime mortgage.\nYou can apply direct to more 2 life Limited for further borrowing of the remaining amount of this facility\nwithout further financial advice. This borrowing is not guaranteed and will be based on the terms available\nfrom more 2 life Limited at the time. The remaining cash facility will be reduced or removed:\n\u2022 If the product is no longer offered by the lender, the lender is no longer in business, Rothesay Life\nplc are no longer funding the lender, or to comply with the regulations governing either the lender\nor Rothesay Life plc\n\u2022 if, the total of (i) the amount outstanding under your lifetime mortgage (including your Initial Lump\nsum, any subsequent cash advances, accrued interest and any charges you have incurred) plus\n(ii) any unused part of your cash facility, exceeds the amount we would agree to lend to a new\nborrower (of equivalent age) in comparable circumstances. If the facility is fully withdrawn for this\nreason, you can repay your lifetime mortgage in full without incurring Early Repayment Charges\n\u2022 if any of the events of default specified in the Loan and Mortgage Conditions as causing the\nagreement to terminate and making the balance immediately due and payable has occurred or\nhave failed to maintain the property in good condition.\n\u2022if you are subject to an undischarged bankruptcy or individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) or have\nbeen discharged from bankruptcy or an IVA\n\u2022 If you own the property as tenants in common, where one applicant dies, the remaining borrower\ncannot access any unutilised cash facility when they are not the sole beneficiary of the deceased\u2019s\nshare of the property.\nAny such further borrowing will be based on the interest rate available from more 2 life Limited at the time\nof application for this product taking account of your then age and the value of your property relative to\nyour total outstanding balance and any unutilised cash facility. The interest rate applicable to such further\nborrowing may be more or less than your initial interest rate. The Offer that we give you at the time of any\ncash advance will set out the interest rate for that cash advance.\nThis lifetime mortgage can only be arranged for either one or two people between the ages of 55 - 84,\nbased on the age of the youngest applicant, who own and live permanently in the property which is\nsubject to the lifetime mortgage.\nIf there are any other outstanding mortgages or charges at the time the loan is taken out, you will be\nrequired to use the lifetime mortgage to clear these loans. As part of the completion process our solicitors\nwill redeem them with the proceeds from the loan.\nInterest is charged at a fixed rate of 6.62% on the initial advance until receipt by more 2 life Limited of all\nmonies due. The interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly, meaning the interest rolls up\nwith interest being charged on that interest, paid when you repay your loan. See Section 8 for example.\nAny cash advances will be subject to the new interest rate payable at the time which will be set out in\nthe Offer that we give you for that cash advance, and will be based on your then age and the value of\nyour property relative to your total outstanding balance and any unutilised cash facility, and which will\nthen be fixed for the lifetime of the loan.\nWe have based this Offer on an estimated term of 15 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime\nmortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 15 years. If you are still living in your home at\nthe end of 15 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run.\nThe loan, accrued interest and charges that may be due, become payable out of the proceeds from the\nsale of your home under the following circumstances;\n\u2022 On your death, or (if joint borrowers) on the death of the last borrower.\n\u2022 If you move home and transferring this lifetime mortgage to the new property does not meet our\nlending conditions.\n\u2022If you move into residential or long-term care on the grounds of medical or other specialist advice.\nAny money left over would be paid to you or your beneficiaries.\nThe maximum amount you can borrow is \u00a3318,000.00. however, if you change the loan amount currently\nrequested, the rate of interest may also change. If you require additional funds you may apply for further\nsecured borrowing subject to availability - see Section 14 for details.\nFC v1.30 1121 Page 4 of 15"}

The FCA require that this Offer is on an estimated term, as detailed in Section 5, but remember that the\nactual term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter. If you are still living in your\nown home at the end of this term, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run and the amount you owe\nwill continue to increase.\n2. more 2 life Limited has the right to take legal action to repossess your house in the following\ncircumstances:\n(a) the property not being sold within 12 months of your death (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the\ndeath of the last borrower) or your entering long-term care (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the last\nborrower entering long-term care) or otherwise vacating the property; (b) compulsory purchase or\nrequisition of all or any part of the property; (c) false information or omission in information given to more\n2 life Limited, including fraud or money laundering; (d) any failure to notify and co-operate with more 2\nlife Limited in relation to an environmental notice issued under the provisions of the Environmental\nProtection Act 1990 or the Water Resources Act 1991 relating to your property or a neighbouring property;\n(e) you use or permit the property to be used otherwise than solely as a private residence; (f) you are or\nbecome bankrupt or enter into a composition or other arrangement with any of your creditors or you have\nbeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been engaged in criminal activity; or (g) you\nare in default under the mortgage conditions.\n3. If negative equity arises, this will be dealt with under the no Negative Equity Guarantee as set out in\nSection 6. If your home is sold for more than the outstanding lifetime mortgage balance, which includes\ninterest, any unpaid charges and costs, you or your estate will receive the difference.\n4. If you move home and want to transfer this lifetime mortgage to the new property, you can do so if the\nnew property meets our lending criteria. You will have to pay a Valuation Fee, Arrangement Fee and our\nand your legal expenses in respect of the new property. If the new property is of a lower value, we may\nask you to repay part of the amount outstanding on the lifetime mortgage.\n5. If you move out of your home into long-term care or residential care your home must be sold and the\nlifetime mortgage repaid. Early repayment charges do not apply if this happens - they are only payable\nif you choose to repay your lifetime mortgage early. Section 13 of this Offer tells you when they are\npayable.\n6. If you want someone else to move into your home to live with you, for example; upon marriage/the\nformation of a civil partnership, or where someone acts as your carer, you must first get more 2 life Limited\nto agree before they move in. Otherwise this will breach the terms of your mortgage. Any persons that\nare currently residing at the property and are not party to the loan may have to sign a waiver in order to\ncontinue living in the property.\n7. You must keep your home in good repair. If you do not keep your home in good repair, more 2 life\nLimited has the right to inspect the property and get the repairs done, but they will tell you first if they\nintend to do this. The cost of any repairs that more 2 life Limited has to arrange will be added to the amount\nyou owe on this lifetime mortgage. Where such costs are not able to be reclaimed on the sale of the\nproperty, they may be excluded from the no Negative Equity Guarantee (see Section 6).\n8. Taking out this mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits, and may also affect\nyour tax position. Tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need\nfurther advice you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, the Pension Service, Benefits Agency or your\nlocal Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau.\n9. The property must currently be mortgage free, or if there is a mortgage outstanding then this must be\neither repaid before or at the time the lifetime mortgage begins.

Equilaw cannot give you any financial advice \r\nregarding the plan\u2019s suitability for your circumstances and requirements, now or in the future.  If you are not \r\nabsolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your financial adviser before \r\nproceeding further.\r\nIf you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you \r\nhave sought further financial advice; from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment \r\nmay not exceed the interest charged on this product.  \r\nAny existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the Property must be repaid from the proceeds of your \r\nequity release.  If you do not intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before \r\nproceeding further.  Unless we hear from you to the contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you \r\nunderstand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity release funds paid to you on \r\ncompletion. \r\nAdditionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, \r\nusing the proceeds of the equity release.  The effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured \r\nagainst the Property.  Please ensure that you have reviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure \r\nthat this is the best course of action in your circumstances.  If this applies in your case, you will find details in \r\nthe \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d section of this report.\r\nYou may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. \r\nto mitigate inheritance tax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing \r\nhome care fees.  The rules and regulations relating to gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually \r\nchanging. The equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose, without careful consideration and \r\nobtaining specialist legal/financial advice. \r\nPlease also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for \r\nyour own quality of life.  Further information and guidance is produced by Age UK and can be found at \r\nwww.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information-guides-and-factsheets/.\r\nIt is important to review and/or make a Will in the context of taking out an equity release plan.  Making a Will \r\ncan achieve significant savings in tax and costs of winding up your estate.  It also means that your assets will be \r\ndistributed in accordance with your wishes and not as provided for by the general laws of intestacy.  You \r\nshould also consider making a Lasting Power of Attorney, which can safeguard your position and ensure that \r\nyour wishes are carried out in relation to the Property, health and finances in the event that you become \r\nincapable of handling these decisions personally in the future.  If you would like to discuss these matters, \r\nplease let me know and I will put you in touch with an appropriate specialist.\r\nYou should read this report, together with the Mortgage Deed, the Loan Agreement and the More 2 Life Terms \r\nand Conditions (hereinafter referred to as \"the Terms and Conditions\") before committing to the scheme.  \r\nIf there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact Natasha Wakefield or your \r\nfinancial adviser, David Cole, before you proceed. You should not go ahead with the scheme until you are \r\nsatisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy with it.\r\nFraud Warning\r\nWe will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional \r\ncorroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third party \r\ndirectly. If you receive any telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do \r\nanything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us immediately using our main office \r\ntelephone number which can be found on our letterhead.

This is a lifetime mortgage, which means you \r\nretain ownership of The Property.\r\n1.2 Amount of Loan\r\nThe maximum amount that More 2 Life is willing to lend is \u00a3318,000.00. At the date of completion, \r\nyou will receive a lump sum of \u00a350,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and \r\nfinancial adviser fees).  You will also have access to a Cash Reserve of \u00a350,000.00.\r\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the Property as security \r\nfor this loan.\r\nYou can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More 2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums \r\nbut will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time \r\nof request.\r\n1.3 Cash Facility\r\nFollowing completion, you will have access to a Cash Facility of \u00a350,000.00.\r\nYou will not be charged interest on the Cash Facility until you draw funds from it.  When you do \r\nwithdraw funds, More 2 Life will charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher \r\nOR lower than the original rate in this offer of 6.62%.  Please ensure that you check the interest rate \r\nto be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the Cash Facility.  \r\nYou can apply at any time, to More 2 Life to borrow any amount within your Cash Facility subject to a \r\nminimum amount of \u00a32,000.00.  \r\nPlease note that More 2 Life does have the right to withdraw the Cash Facility at any time, as set out \r\nin Part 1, s 2.4 of the Terms and Conditions and section 5 of your Mortgage Offer.\r\nIf you have used all of your Cash Facility, you can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More \r\n2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current \r\nlending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. \r\nYou have asked for an initial advance of \u00a350,000.00 which will be released as a lump sum on \r\ncompletion, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees).\r\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (ie, mortgage) against the title of 86 Overslade \r\nLane, Rugby, Warwickshire, CV22 6EF (\u201cthe Property\u201d) as security for this loan."}

Interest \r\nis calculated daily and added to the loan monthly. \r\nThe Annual Percentage Rate is 7.0%.\r\nYou are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. Unpaid \r\ninterest will be added to the loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount \r\n(\u201crolling up\u201d). The interest continues to roll up, at the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid.   Over a long \r\nperiod of time this can reach high levels especially if you are not making any periodic voluntary \r\nrepayments.  If house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the Property will be \r\neroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against its \r\nvalue. \r\nThe requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the Property has been abandoned. This will \r\neither be because you have died, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live there. Please \r\nnote that interest continues to roll up until the mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result \r\nof selling the Property); it will not stop just because you are no longer living there.\r\nSection 8 of your Mortgage Offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the \r\nestimated loan period. The loan period may be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, \r\nwhich will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest which accrues.   \r\n1.5 No Negative Equity Guarantee.\r\nMore 2 Life provides a \u201cno negative equity\u201d guarantee.  This means if, at the date of repayment of the \r\nmortgage, you or your estate owe more than the value of The Property, More 2 Life will not seek to \r\nrecover any further amount than the proceeds of sale.  \r\nThis guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the Terms and Conditions of the plan; \r\nfor example, keeping the Property in good repair and condition. As such, if More 2 Life has had to \r\nundertake repairs on your behalf those costs (and interest) would fall outside of the no negative \r\nequity guarantee.\r\nThe guarantee only applies when the Property is sold to repay the loan. It will not apply if your \r\nbeneficiaries wish to keep the Property and repay the loan, or if you wish to move to a new house, \r\nbecause the total debt secured against the Property will reduce the available equity for a new \r\nProperty. It would also not apply if the Property is sold below its(reasonable) market value. \r\nAll of the lenders that belong to the Equity Release Council offer a \u201cno-negative equity guarantee\u201d \r\nwhich means that if the level of the loan outstrips the value of the Property when it is sold, More 2 \r\nLife cannot pursue you or your estate for any shortfall. However, there is very likely to be a cost built \r\ninto the loan in return for offering this guarantee.  This is not specified anywhere by More 2 Life, or \r\nbroken down, so I cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything).  The downside is that if the \r\nProperty's value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that \r\nyou do not need.  However, if the loan does outstrip the Property's value, you may find the guarantee \r\nvery valuable.  There is not currently an \u201cEquity Release Council approved\u201d product which does not \r\ncarry this guarantee, so if you want a product which meets Council standards, there is no alternative.  \r\nIf you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your financial adviser \r\nimmediately to explore any other options which may be available to you.\r\n1.6 Once the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, \r\ndepending on the size of the loan you are taking, versus the value of the Property.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128500", "filename": "128500/61.pdf", "page_num": 8, "text": "5\r\nGAR0392/001.0/Natasha WakefieldTerms and Conditions at Section 1 paragraph 7). provided that the Property you want to move to is \r\nacceptable to More 2 Life.  However, this is not guaranteed.  Examples of where More 2 Life may not \r\nagree to transfer the mortgage to another Property might include a flat, where the lease does not \r\nhave enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the Property is of non-standard construction.\r\nIf More 2 Life is agreeable to \u201cporting\u201d (ie, transferring) your mortgage to a new Property, and your \r\nplanned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of \r\nthe loan.  No early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. If you intend to move home \r\nand wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve More 2 Life from the outset.  The \r\nsolicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors at all stages to ensure \r\nthat More 2 Life is satisfied as to the title of the new Property and is willing to (continue to) lend.  \r\nOnly once More 2 Life has confirmed that it is satisfied with the new Property, will their solicitors \r\nprovide your solicitors authority to exchange.  You must not progress the transaction to a stage where \r\nyou are contractually obliged to purchase the new Property without More 2 Life\u2019s consent.\r\nIf your proposed new Property is acceptable to More 2 Life  and you decide to repay the loan, you \r\nmay attract an early repayment charge.\r\nIf your proposed new home does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the \r\nmortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. Furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your \r\nloan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to \r\ndo so without early repayment charge.\r\nYou should always obtain More 2 Life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any \r\nsignificant expenditure in the event that this is not possible.\r\n1.8 Sale of Part of the Property \r\nIf you are seeking to sell part of the Property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell More 2 \r\nLife and seek More 2 Life\u2019s prior consent in accordance with part 2, section 4.13 of the Terms and \r\nConditions.  If the sale of part of the Property reduces its value, it is likely that you may be required to \r\nrepay some of the loan. \r\n1.9 Taxation on the Loan\r\nThe loan is tax-free under present legislation. \r\nWhilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and \r\ngovernments can apply any new rules retrospectively.  If such a change occurred, you may have to \r\npay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax \r\nposition.  However, this is unlikely.\r\nWhat will it cost to set up?\r\n2.1 Financial Adviser\u2019s Fee\r\nWe have been advised by Viva Retirement Solutions that fees of \u00a3750.00 have been agreed between \r\nyou.  We will pay this amount directly to Viva Retirement Solutions from your completion funds.  \r\n2.2 Legal Fees\r\nYou are responsible for Equilaw\u2019s fees, disbursements and VAT of \u00a3699.00, as detailed in our initial \r\nestimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for \r\nextra work, as applicable."}

We \r\nare not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is \r\nprovided with the intended completion date.  We will always make you aware of any additional \r\ndisbursements as soon as we are made aware. \r\nThe costs can be as follows (unless this is a purchase or first registration):-\r\nPossible disbursements (where they apply) \r\nRegistration fee for first registration Variable as per HMLR Fee Scale \r\nCopy lease or other deed \u00a33 each \r\nK15 \u00a32 each name \r\nOS2 \u00a33 per title\r\nYour obligations and what you have agreed to do \r\n3.1 Borrowing\r\nYou have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) from the \r\nproceeds of the equity release funds and you cannot use the Property as security for any further \r\nborrowing; unless More 2 Life gives its written permission, which is unlikely.\r\n3.2 Who can live in the Property?\r\nOnly the people named in the Mortgage Offer can live at the Property, subject to the paragraph \r\ntitle \"Moving a New Person into the Property\" below.  \r\n3.3 Moving a new person into the Property\r\nIf you want somebody else to move into The Property, you must seek More 2 Life\u2019s authority to do \r\nso.  The new occupier will be required to sign More 2 Life's Occupier's Waiver form and may require \r\nindependent legal advice. You or the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees before they \r\nmove in.\r\nPlease note that More 2 Life states that, once this mortgage is completed, you cannot add another \r\nborrower.  As such, if you wanted to change the ownership of the Property, you\u2019d need to pay back \r\nMore 2 Life first (eg, by re-mortgaging) as a new person cannot be added to this particular \r\nmortgage. If you do this within the early repayment term, you will incur an early repayment \r\npenalty.\r\n3.4 Residence\r\nThis must be your permanent residence (i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your \r\npossessions). If you are planning to leave the Property empty for 3 months or longer, you must \r\ninform More 2 Life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so in accordance with the Terms \r\nand Conditions.  \r\nIt is important that you do this so that More 2 Life does not consider you to have moved out \r\npermanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale \r\nof the Property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges.  \r\nYou must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the Property.  \r\nUsually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the Property empty for 30 days or more.\r\n3.5 You can live in the Property for as long as you either want or need to (if you do not breach any of \r\nthe mortgage conditions).  Please carefully read the Terms and Conditions paying particular \r\nattention to the legal definitions (including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and \r\ndefault.  "}

More 2 Life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it \r\ndecides to inspect (except in cases of emergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse.  This is an \r\nentirely standard condition in most residential mortgages please see Part 2 section 4.4 of the Terms \r\nand Conditions.\r\n3.7 Repair & Maintenance\r\nYou have agreed to keep the Property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not \r\nadversely affected by allowing it to fall into disrepair.\r\nIf More 2 Life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be \r\nundertaken, this must be done within the time stipulated or More 2 Life is entitled to send its own \r\nworkmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it.  If you cannot (or do not) reimburse More \r\n2 Life for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage and interest \r\nthen added to it, which will compound and roll up.\r\nPlease also note that if you do not keep the Property in reasonable condition, the no-negative \r\nequity guarantee would not extend to these costs and charges. Please see section 6 of the offer and \r\nsection 2, paragraphs.4.2 and 13 of the Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.8 Insurance\r\nYou must keep the Property fully insured, by a company approved by More 2 Life, for all usual and \r\ncomprehensive risks to restore the Property, to its present condition. If it is damaged or destroyed \r\nthe cover should include cover for demolition, site clearance and architect\u2019s plans to rebuild the \r\nProperty. The reinstatement sum insured must be no less than \u00a3400,000.00, as stated in your \r\nMortgage Offer. If your policy is not index-linked then you must ensure The Property is insured for \r\nat least 10% more than the amount recommended by More 2 Life.\r\nYou must ensure that More 2 Life is noted as an interested party on the policy. (i.e that The \r\nProperty insurance is in the joint names of yourself and \u201cMore 2 Life Equity Release Ltd\u201d).  We will \r\nrequire sight of the new insurance policy immediately after completion, to enable us to check it \r\nmeets More 2 Life\u2019s requirements.\r\nMore 2 Life may require you to produce a copy of your buildings insurance from time to time to \r\ncheck that you are adequately covered.  If the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is \r\nindex-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. A copy will be required for \r\ncompletion, and therefore please send it to us, if you have not already done so.\r\nIf you do not insure the Property, More 2 Life will do this for you but will re-charge the cost of the \r\ninsurance premium to you. You must pay these sums on demand and please be aware that the \r\ninsurance will be to protect More 2 Life's interest and therefore may not be suitable for your own \r\nrequirements. We recommend that you always source your own suitable insurance and keep up to \r\ndate with the premiums to avoid More 2 Life stepping in.\r\nIf an insurable event occurs (e.g. a fire or flood), you must immediately inform More 2 Life. More 2 \r\nLife has the right to negotiate with the insurer on your behalf.  Any monies paid under the \r\ninsurance policy will be held by you on trust for More 2 Life and must be used to make good the \r\nloss and damage. More 2 Life can elect, acting reasonably, to use any proceeds of such a claim to \r\nreduce or repay the total debt owing, instead of rebuilding the Property. It would be unlikely for \r\nMore 2 Life to do this, unless it was wholly impractical or impossible to facilitate the rebuild of the \r\nProperty. Please review Section 2, paragraphs 4.8 and 4.9 of the Terms and Conditions for further \r\ndetails. "}

It is also likely that \r\nthese persons will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, \r\nonce you have passed away or if you have left the Property to move into long term care.  They will \r\nneed to notify More 2 Life of this event and be aware of More 2 Life\u2019s requirements regarding \r\nrepayment of the loan.\r\n3.10 Legal Notice, Orders or Proposals effecting the Property.\r\nYou must immediately inform More 2 Life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to \r\nthe Property.\r\n3.11 Alterations to the Property\r\nYou must seek More 2 Life's permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the \r\nProperty (eg, new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require \r\nplanning consent and/or building regulations approval)  This is an additional requirement and we \r\nstrongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building \r\nregulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from More 2 Life in principle as, \r\nif it refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work.  Lenders do not usually \r\nwithhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of Property development which do \r\nnot fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better \r\nto be certain before committing to any projects.\r\nIf you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as Green \r\nDeal) you must first obtain the written permission of More 2 Life to do so (usually in case this is \r\nsecured against the Property, which is not allowed by More 2 Life).\r\n3.12 Acquiring additional land adjoining the Property\r\nIf you buy or acquire any land next to the Property, please notify More 2 Life.  More 2 Life may \r\nrequire you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land.  This is because the new \r\npiece of land may be of strategic importance to the Property (e.g. for development) and the value \r\ncan be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. Please see Section 2, paragraph 4.14 \r\nof the Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.13 Renting out the Property\r\nYou cannot rent out the Property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself.  If you wish to do so, \r\nplease contact More 2 Life to discuss your options.\r\nIf More 2 Life does not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a \u201cBuy to Let\u201d product.  \r\nYour financial adviser will be able to assist you and talk you through the costs of doing so.\r\n3.14 Business Use\r\nYou cannot use The Property for business purposes.  If you wish to do so you must contact More 2 \r\nLife to seek its permission which may be refused. As such, if this is something that you are likely to \r\nwant to do, you should speak to your financial adviser now to understand your options.\r\n3.15 Impact on Benefits\r\nReceipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to \r\nmeans-tested State benefits, such as Pension Credit or Council Tax benefits.  If you think you may \r\nbe entitled to any such benefits, OR you receive means-tested benefits already, please speak to \r\nyour financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore \r\nyour options in advance of taking up this equity release.\r\n3.16 Special Conditions Imposed by More 2 Life"}

Please contact your insurance provider to effect this change. Once \r\nyou have done so, please forward a copy of the insurance schedule to us in order to satisfy this \r\nrequirement.\r\nWhen does the loan have to be repaid? \r\n4.1 The loan contract ends if and when: \r\n\uf0b7the last owner of the Property dies, goes into long-term care (which may be either \r\nsheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of \r\n\u201cPayment Date\u201d in the Terms and Conditions, which you should read carefully) and \r\nexplains what is regarded as long-term care; or\r\n\uf0b7you purchase another Property and the loan cannot be ported; or\r\n\uf0b7the Property is permanently abandoned (please see the definition of \u201cPayment Date\u201d in \r\nthe Terms and Conditions); or\r\n\uf0b7you are declared bankrupt; or\r\n\uf0b7you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in Section 1, paragraph 9 \r\nTerms & Conditions\r\nThe amount to repay will include the capital borrowed, plus all rolled-up interest and any costs \r\nincurred by More 2 Life (for example repair costs). \r\nThe term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 8 of your Mortgage Offer is 15 years.  This \r\ndoes not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and \r\nthe overall repayment amount will increase the longer it runs.\r\n4.2 Impact of Loan ending due to Death or long term care\r\nIf the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then More 2 Life may request medical or \r\nother specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused.\r\nThe term will also end on the last borrower's death. No early repayment charges will be payable in \r\nthese circumstances, but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (again, \r\nusually when the Property is sold).\r\n4.3 Sale of the Property \r\nYou or your Attorney (if you have appointed one under a Power of Attorney) or Personal \r\nRepresentatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the Property following \r\nthe last borrower entering into long term care or dying.  If the Property is not sold within 12 months \r\nMore 2 Life may take over conduct of the sale.  This would usually be if More 2 Life perceived no \r\nprogress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances.\r\n4.4 Bankruptcy and/or Breach of Material Contract Terms\r\nThe loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the \r\nTerms and Conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in Section 1, paragraph 9 and Section \r\n2, paragraph 4 of the Terms and Conditions, including being declared bankrupt.  Please note that \r\nearly repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances.\r\n4.5 Early Repayment Charges.\r\nEarly repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the Terms and \r\nConditions."}

However, if you chose to do this prior \r\nto the 15 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge.\r\nThe early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date:\r\n\uf0b7up to the 1st anniversary the charge is 10% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 2nd anniversary the charge is 9% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 3rd anniversary the charge is 8% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 4th anniversary the charge is 7% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 6% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 6th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 7th anniversary the charge is 4% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 8th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 9th anniversary the charge is 2% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 15th anniversary the charge is 1% of the amount repaid;\r\nAfter 15th anniversary is no charge.\r\n4.6 Exemption from Early Repayment Charges\r\nNo Early repayment penalty will be charged if:\r\n\uf0b7you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies;\r\n\uf0b7after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your \r\nnew property does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria;\r\n\uf0b7the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage \r\nto the Property;\r\n\uf0b7you make a voluntary partial repayment;\r\n\uf0b7the lifetime mortgage is repaid by remaining borrower within 3 years of the death or \r\nrequirement for long term care of first borrower;\r\n\uf0b7the cash faciity is withdrawn; or\r\n\uf0b7you downsize to a lower value Property and are requested to make a partial repayment.\r\n4.7 Voluntary Partial Early Repayments\r\nMore 2 Life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge:\r\n\uf0b7Maximum payment of 10% of the total cash advanced within each 12 month period \r\nfollowing completion; and\r\n\uf0b7Minimum payment of \u00a350; and\r\n\uf0b7Maximum of twelve payments in a 12 month period\r\nPlease note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, an early repayment charge will apply (if this is \r\nwithin the early repayment term).  Where you do make partial repayments, it will reduce the level \r\nof loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up over time. \r\nIf you intend to make a Voluntary Partial Repayment, please ensure that you contact More 2 Life \r\nbefore you make it.\r\nAny proportion of the permitted voluntary partial repayments amount that is unused cannot be \r\ncarried forward into the next 12-month period."}

You have the option to repay in \r\nfull, should you so wish, subject to the Early Repayment calculation as set out above.\r\n5.5 Subject to you complying with the Terms and Conditions, More 2 Life offers a no-negative equity \r\nguarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the Property, even if \r\nthe level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in the Property.  \r\nWhat are the disadvantages?\r\n6.1 Means-tested State benefits, such as Pension Credit or Council Tax benefits may be affected.  You \r\nshould therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) \r\nbefore proceeding with this loan.\r\n6.2 The loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in The Property over time, \r\nespecially where no voluntary repayments are made, and particularly if house prices do not rise and \r\nyou have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of The Property.\r\n6.3 Further loans against the Property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans \r\nwill be permitted by More 2 Life while its loan is still in existence.  A further advance from More 2 \r\nLife (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the \r\nremaining equity in The Property.\r\n6.4 If you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt, the Property can be repossessed (see \r\nSection 1, paragraph 9 of the Terms and Conditions).\r\n6.5 This is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply, should you wish to redeem the \r\nloan early (or if the Property is repossessed). For your peace of mind, More 2 Life has set a \r\nmaximum figure which can be charged of \u00a35,341.23, which allows you to conduct a \u201ccost versus \r\nbenefit\u201d assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging.\r\nThe calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of your Mortgage Offer."}

This may incur early repayment charges.  If you are deemed \r\nto be in default, the no-negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by More \r\n2 Life as a result of the breaches.\r\nMore 2 Life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach.\r\nRepossession would always be a matter of last resort.\r\n7.2 If you move to a new house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on the \r\ncircumstances.\r\n  \r\n7.3 Further additional secured borrowing from More 2 Life is not guaranteed. In addition, the drawdown \r\nfacility can be removed without notice by More 2 Life at any time without prior notice.\r\n7.4 If you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment \r\npenalty will apply if you wish to re-mortgage with another lender.\r\n7.5 If the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you \r\nowe tax on the lump sum that you have taken, albeit unlikely.\r\n7.6 If you do not make any voluntary interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost \r\nof this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the Property in due \r\ncourse, particularly if the value of the Property does not go up over time.  This means that you would \r\nnot be able to leave the Property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your Wills, but you can leave \r\nany remaining equity once the Property has been sold.\r\n7.7 Eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely affected. \r\n7.8 Any existing charge secured against the Property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your \r\nequity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion.\r\n7.9 If your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively \r\nconverting this into a debt secured against The Property, which is enforceable if you default by \r\nrepossession.  You should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that \r\nthis is the best course of action for you.  \r\nReward:\r\n7.10 You will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use.\r\n7.11 There is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than \r\nthe value of The Property (provided there are no material breaches of the Terms and Conditions). \r\n7.12 You can potentially \u201cport\u201d this mortgage to a new Property if you want to move to a new house."}

If you are willing to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive \r\nto outweigh the risks involved, the next step is to arrange an appointment to complete and sign the \r\nrequired documentation.  If you are still unsure, or we can clarify any aspect for you, please do not \r\nhesitate to telephone Natasha Wakefield.  \r\nYou should keep this report for future reference.\r\n8.2 Appointment \r\nIn order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully.  It \r\nis a matter of law that the deed MUST be executed in the physical presence of an independent \r\nperson.  The Equity Release Council (\"ERC\") guidelines require this to be a solicitor.\r\nWe note that you would like to have your solicitor's appointment at home with a local solicitor. Please \r\ncontact Natasha Wakefield  to arrange a Solicitors appointment date, it would be helpful if you could \r\nreview your diary in preparation for this telephone call and, if possible, reschedule any non-critical \r\nappointments, as our home visit solicitors are not in your area every day. Due to the nature of their \r\nrole, which entails driving to each appointment, we will book your appointment on the next \r\nconvenient and available day and then contact you by text the day before to give you the \r\napproximate time that our solicitor will arrive which will be within a one hour window, enabling you \r\nto arrange your day around your appointment. If you have not heard from us by 3.00pm please call us \r\non 01452 376702. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the \r\nappointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every \r\nendeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each \r\nday visiting clients, occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents \r\nor other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment.  \r\nThe attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation \r\nand not to provide you with any legal advice.  Legal advice is provided by us within this \u201cMortgage \r\nReport\u201d.  If you have any questions or queries arising from this report, please direct these to Natasha \r\nWakefield in advance of the appointment. \r\nIn preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed Document Checklist and ensure that all of \r\ndocuments listed are available.  If any documents are missing, please contact Natasha Wakefield prior \r\nto the appointment so we can arrange for any replacement documents to be sent to you in readiness.  \r\nIf the missing documents are those in your care and control, but are unavailable, please telephone \r\nNatasha Wakefield so that we can discuss how best to proceed.\r\nWe anticipate that the Solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. Please note that only \r\nthe equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. The solicitor will need \r\nto verify your identity at the appointment and take copies of the documentation provided.  Please \r\nensure you have:\r\n\uf0b7Valid photographic signature identification: i.e Passport, Driving Licence, National Identity \r\nCard AND Address verification: i.e bank statement;\r\n\uf0b7Utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current Council \r\nTax Bill naming each borrower.\r\nVery occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your \r\ninitial signing appointment.  To minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via Skype or Facetime.  \r\nIf you are not able to access this via your own (or a family/friends\u2019) mobile device, or via public \r\ncomputers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local solicitor who will charge \u00a35 per "}

If this is required. we will notify you and provide our Skype/Facetime \r\naddress at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. \r\n8.3 Cost of the Solicitor Appointment\r\nThe costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute \r\nmeeting.  If you cancel or fail to attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') \r\nnotice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to be met.  If the appointment is no longer \r\nconvenient, please contact us as a matter of urgency.  \r\n8.4 Identification\r\nWe must provide a \u201cguarantee\u201d of your identity to More 2 Life at the point of requesting the funds.  \r\nIn order to be able to give this guarantee, we will need valid photographic identity evidence i.e a \r\ndriving licence or signed passport.  If you do not have such identification, then we will require a \r\nphotograph certified by an acceptable counter-signatory confirming your identity.  \r\nPlease see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter-\r\nsignatories.  Please contact Natasha Wakefield to obtain a form for your counter-signatory to \r\ncomplete which will then satisfy More 2 Lifes required guarantee.\r\nAdditionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and Mortgage Offer must match exactly.  \r\nIf there is a name discrepancy, we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your \r\nbirth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s). We will require the original(s) but will return these to \r\nyou immediately. \r\nIf there is an address discrepancy, we will need multiple address verification including: your most \r\nrecent council tax invoice AND a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, \r\nor a DWP pension letter.\r\nIf you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or \r\ndiscrepancy to resolve, please let Natasha Wakefield in advance of the appointment, so that we can \r\ninstruct your attending solicitor to obtain all necessary documentation.\r\n8.5 Next Steps\r\nOnce we have received your signed documentation, we endeavour to send all documentation to \r\nMore 2 Life\u2019s solicitor within 2 working days by guaranteed next day special delivery.   We can only \r\nforward these documents when all required conditions have been satisfied and all documentation \r\nreceived. \r\nPlease ensure the Document Checklist has been fully completed.\r\nOn a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or \r\nsubsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will take place within approximately 11 \r\nworking days.   This timescale is only an estimate and is not guaranteed.  As such, we strongly \r\nrecommend that you do not commit/spend the proceeds until we confirm completion is taking place, \r\nwhich we will do by telephone in advance.\r\nIf your case has any additional elements, we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, \r\nbecause we are often waiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and \r\nimpossible to guarantee.  Natasha Wakefield will keep you up to date with progress on your case.\r\nWe will endeavour to secure the earliest possible completion date (if that is what you would like) but \r\nif there is any particular urgency attaching to your case, or significance around a date (including a \r\nneed to delay), please inform Natasha Wakefield so that we can do our best to meet your \r\nexpectations."}

Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for Ukraine scheme \r\nand no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require \r\nhousing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are \r\ntherefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all \r\ncases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to \r\nrefugees, please let us know immediately. \r\nTax or Financial advice\r\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose \r\nof the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent \r\ntax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about \r\ngiving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your \r\npreferred (or required) outcome.\r\nCharges\r\nIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid \r\nany delays to your Equity Release.\r\nPlease do not cancel any direct debits/standing orders until after completion. Any overpayment \r\nmade will be refunded by your current lender. If you cancel your direct debit/standing order before \r\ncompletion it may cause the amount repaid to be insufficient to clear the existing debt and this \r\nwould then prevent your Equity Release Lender from securing their charge over the property.  This is \r\nin breach of their terms and conditions. \r\nFees and Expenses\r\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-\r\ninclusive fee of \u00a3699. The all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-\r\nforward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors \r\nsigning appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\r\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the \r\nassumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. Should your case have any \r\nadditional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to \r\nresolve. Our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional \r\nwork is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's requirement. Any additional fee \r\nwork is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the \r\nadditional charge remains payable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity \r\nRelease funds."}

These fraudsters have \r\nrealised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or \r\nphone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this \r\nmoney by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of \r\nmoney to the fraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever \r\nrecovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is \r\nincreasingly prevalent.  \r\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their \r\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  \r\nEqually we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such \r\nunlawful interception. \r\nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact \r\ndetails, published by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  \r\nOur Head Office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, \r\nespecially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a \r\nchange in contact details here. \r\nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts \r\ninvolved exceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\r\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you \r\nmay send us any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document \r\nand this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\r\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other \r\nbank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds \r\nto any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any \r\noutstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security \r\nquestions so that we can be sure we are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email \r\nmessage that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third \r\nparty, then please call us immediately using our main office telephone number 01452 657999.\r\nWhat should you be looking out for?\r\n\uf0b7Sudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\r\n\uf0b7Last minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\r\n\uf0b7Last minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\r\n\uf0b7Callers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\r\n\uf0b7Requests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\r\n\uf0b7The cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\r\n\uf0b7Emails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\r\nHow can you protect yourself?\r\n\uf0b7Don\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\r\n\uf0b7Don\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\r\n\uf0b7Check all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\r\n\uf0b7Check that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\r\n\uf0b7We will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\r\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT \r\nPROBABLY IS!"}

Office hours are 9.00 am to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, \r\nalthough arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\r\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\r\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will \r\nconfirm this in writing.  We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of \r\nengagement, together with their direct dial telephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  \r\nWe aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day and to respond to written communications \r\nwithin two working days.  \r\nYour Responsibilities\r\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about \r\nyour matter at the outset, so that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide \r\nus with full contact details: mobile/home/work telephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new \r\ninformation becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances change.  Where we act for more than one \r\nclient jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \r\nOur Charges\r\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis \r\non which we will charge you. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to \r\ndo and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements).  \r\nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility \r\nthat we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change \r\nthe work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that \r\nthe work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, \r\nand that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your work within the overall \r\ncost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete \r\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will \r\nremain liable for the work done, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees \r\nschedule that may be found in the supplement to this document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if \r\nwe have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is freehold, and it transpires that the property is \r\nleasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed that our own fees \r\nmay be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity \r\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for \r\nthese costs.\r\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\r\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel \r\nthe appointment giving less than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action \r\nor inaction to schedule a further appointment, we will charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment \r\nand we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that \u2018working day\u2019 in this context means \r\nMonday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. \r\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of \r\nyour equity release application this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your \r\napplication fails to complete the cost of the appointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment."}

All interim \r\nstatute bills are due for payment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not \r\nproceed to completion should be made in sterling either by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank \r\naccount (details on request).  \r\nShortfalls and Completion Funds\r\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for \r\nshortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged \r\nunder the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you \r\nand we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We are happy to accept debit card \r\npayments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card unless in exceptional circumstances. \r\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\r\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with \r\ndeposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held \r\nqualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee scheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, \r\ntechnically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from the Inland Revenue\u2019s point of \r\nview, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any \r\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. "}

Why do you want it as well? \r\nWe are required, by your Lender\u2019s solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering \r\nRegulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity \r\nevidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an Identify Verification Form should \r\nbe completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the attending \r\nsolicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to \r\nallow us to provide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\r\n3. I have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you? \r\nWe have to provide details to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do \r\nrequire a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance \r\nfor completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion.\r\n4.Do I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation? \r\nYes.  The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key requirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as \r\na \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the Equity Release and to guarantee your \r\nidentity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is \r\nrequired of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for \r\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, \r\nthat is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.  \r\n5. How do I book my solicitors appointment?\r\nDepending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or \r\nyou will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to \r\nyou within 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the \r\nsame number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or \r\nhave not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. Please make \r\nsure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor \r\narrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because \r\nour solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather \r\nconditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment.  \r\n6. I cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \r\nWe can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that \r\nwe cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor.  You may wish to use \r\nyour own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the \r\nappointment.  \r\n7. The solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\r\nPlease telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time \r\nis required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\r\n8. Should we update our Wills at the same time?\r\nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or updated following any \r\nchange in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a \r\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, \r\nespecially if you have a drawdown product.  \r\n9.Why should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \r\nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of \r\nexperience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced \r\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client \r\nfeedback on webpage, Twitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards. \r\n10. When will you be in touch with me? \r\nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt \r\nof your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) "}

If I/we fail to do so, I/we will \r\nimmediately breach the terms and conditions of my/our mortgage, for which the lender can \r\nrequest and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any loss as a \r\nresult of such an occupier moving in with me/us, they can pursue me/us for that loss.\r\n6.The interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost \r\nof this interest plus the capital of the loan could wipe out the whole of the value of our \r\nProperty in due course. This means that we would not be able to leave our Property or any \r\npart of it to beneficiaries under our Will."}

If there are any matters arising from either the Report, or the offer itself, please \r\nlet me know immediately and I will attempt to address them on your behalf.\r\nPlease ensure that you read all of the information regarding your chosen product set out in the \r\nmortgage report and are satisfied with the contents before proceeding. Please check that your \r\nappointment details have been finalised and refer to the Document checklist which confirms the \r\ndocuments that you will need to have with you when you have your appointment with your solicitor \r\nto enable us to progress your matter to completion.\r\nWe have recently been informed by More 2 Life, that the interest rate applicable to your equity \r\nrelease plan may change on  (if interest rates have changed at the time your current offer expires).  \r\nYour offer was issued on  and is valid for  days from that date.  In order to accept your offer, the \r\nsigned mortgage documents must be with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors no later than 5 working days prior \r\nto the expiry date. As the offer expires on  we would need to send signed papers to More 2 Life\u2019s \r\nsolicitors no later than . \r\nIf this timescale is not met, More 2 Life will re-offer, at their prevailing interest rate (which may be \r\nhigher).  If the mortgage re-offer is at a higher rate of interest this will increase the amount paid over \r\nthe lifetime of the loan or, if you are servicing the interest payments, these will rise and you should "}

Equilaw cannot give you any financial advice \r\nregarding the plan\u2019s suitability for your circumstances and requirements, now or in the future.  If you are not \r\nabsolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your financial adviser before \r\nproceeding further.\r\nIf you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you \r\nhave sought further financial advice; from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment \r\nmay not exceed the interest charged on this product.  \r\nAny existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the Property must be repaid from the proceeds of your \r\nequity release.  If you do not intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before \r\nproceeding further.  Unless we hear from you to the contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you \r\nunderstand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity release funds paid to you on \r\ncompletion. \r\nAdditionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, \r\nusing the proceeds of the equity release.  The effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured \r\nagainst the Property.  Please ensure that you have reviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure \r\nthat this is the best course of action in your circumstances.  If this applies in your case, you will find details in \r\nthe \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d section of this report.\r\nYou may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. \r\nto mitigate inheritance tax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing \r\nhome care fees.  The rules and regulations relating to gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually \r\nchanging. The equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose, without careful consideration and \r\nobtaining specialist legal/financial advice. \r\nPlease also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for \r\nyour own quality of life.  Further information and guidance is produced by Age UK and can be found at \r\nwww.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information-guides-and-factsheets/.\r\nIt is important to review and/or make a Will in the context of taking out an equity release plan.  Making a Will \r\ncan achieve significant savings in tax and costs of winding up your estate.  It also means that your assets will be \r\ndistributed in accordance with your wishes and not as provided for by the general laws of intestacy.  You \r\nshould also consider making a Lasting Power of Attorney, which can safeguard your position and ensure that \r\nyour wishes are carried out in relation to the Property, health and finances in the event that you become \r\nincapable of handling these decisions personally in the future.  If you would like to discuss these matters, \r\nplease let me know and I will put you in touch with an appropriate specialist.\r\nYou should read this report, together with the Mortgage Deed, the Loan Agreement and the More 2 Life Terms \r\nand Conditions (hereinafter referred to as \"the Terms and Conditions\") before committing to the scheme.  \r\nIf there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact Natasha Wakefield or your \r\nfinancial adviser, David Cole, before you proceed. You should not go ahead with the scheme until you are \r\nsatisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy with it.\r\nFraud Warning\r\nWe will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional \r\ncorroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third party \r\ndirectly. If you receive any telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks you to do \r\nanything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us immediately using our main office \r\ntelephone number which can be found on our letterhead.

This is a lifetime mortgage, which means you \r\nretain ownership of The Property.\r\n1.2 Amount of Loan\r\nThe maximum amount that More 2 Life is willing to lend is \u00a3318,000.00. At the date of completion, \r\nyou will receive a lump sum of \u00a350,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and \r\nfinancial adviser fees).  You will also have access to a Cash Reserve of \u00a350,000.00.\r\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the Property as security \r\nfor this loan.\r\nYou can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More 2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums \r\nbut will consider the request in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time \r\nof request.\r\n1.3 Cash Facility\r\nFollowing completion, you will have access to a Cash Facility of \u00a350,000.00.\r\nYou will not be charged interest on the Cash Facility until you draw funds from it.  When you do \r\nwithdraw funds, More 2 Life will charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher \r\nOR lower than the original rate in this offer of 6.62%.  Please ensure that you check the interest rate \r\nto be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the Cash Facility.  \r\nYou can apply at any time, to More 2 Life to borrow any amount within your Cash Facility subject to a \r\nminimum amount of \u00a32,000.00.  \r\nPlease note that More 2 Life does have the right to withdraw the Cash Facility at any time, as set out \r\nin Part 1, s 2.4 of the Terms and Conditions and section 5 of your Mortgage Offer.\r\nIf you have used all of your Cash Facility, you can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More \r\n2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the request in accordance with its current \r\nlending criteria and terms, as at the time of request. \r\nYou have asked for an initial advance of \u00a350,000.00 which will be released as a lump sum on \r\ncompletion, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees).\r\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (ie, mortgage) against the title of 86 Overslade \r\nLane, Rugby, Warwickshire, CV22 6EF (\u201cthe Property\u201d) as security for this loan."}
{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128500", "filename": "128500/63.pdf", "page_num": 7, "text": "4\r\nGAR0392/001.0/Natasha Wakefield1.4 Interest \r\nThe interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 6.62%.  Interest \r\nis calculated daily and added to the loan monthly. \r\nThe Annual Percentage Rate is 7.0%.\r\nYou are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. Unpaid \r\ninterest will be added to the loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount \r\n(\u201crolling up\u201d). The interest continues to roll up, at the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid.   Over a long \r\nperiod of time this can reach high levels especially if you are not making any periodic voluntary \r\nrepayments.  If house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the Property will be \r\neroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against its \r\nvalue. \r\nThe requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the Property has been abandoned. This will \r\neither be because you have died, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live there. Please \r\nnote that interest continues to roll up until the mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result \r\nof selling the Property); it will not stop just because you are no longer living there.\r\nSection 8 of your Mortgage Offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the \r\nestimated loan period. The loan period may be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, \r\nwhich will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest which accrues.   \r\n1.5 No Negative Equity Guarantee.\r\nMore 2 Life provides a \u201cno negative equity\u201d guarantee.  This means if, at the date of repayment of the \r\nmortgage, you or your estate owe more than the value of The Property, More 2 Life will not seek to \r\nrecover any further amount than the proceeds of sale.  \r\nThis guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the Terms and Conditions of the plan; \r\nfor example, keeping the Property in good repair and condition. As such, if More 2 Life has had to \r\nundertake repairs on your behalf those costs (and interest) would fall outside of the no negative \r\nequity guarantee.\r\nThe guarantee only applies when the Property is sold to repay the loan. It will not apply if your \r\nbeneficiaries wish to keep the Property and repay the loan, or if you wish to move to a new house, \r\nbecause the total debt secured against the Property will reduce the available equity for a new \r\nProperty. It would also not apply if the Property is sold below its(reasonable) market value. \r\nAll of the lenders that belong to the Equity Release Council offer a \u201cno-negative equity guarantee\u201d \r\nwhich means that if the level of the loan outstrips the value of the Property when it is sold, More 2 \r\nLife cannot pursue you or your estate for any shortfall. However, there is very likely to be a cost built \r\ninto the loan in return for offering this guarantee.  This is not specified anywhere by More 2 Life, or \r\nbroken down, so I cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything).  The downside is that if the \r\nProperty's value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that \r\nyou do not need.  However, if the loan does outstrip the Property's value, you may find the guarantee \r\nvery valuable.  There is not currently an \u201cEquity Release Council approved\u201d product which does not \r\ncarry this guarantee, so if you want a product which meets Council standards, there is no alternative.  \r\nIf you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your financial adviser \r\nimmediately to explore any other options which may be available to you.\r\n1.6 Once the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, \r\ndepending on the size of the loan you are taking, versus the value of the Property.  Compound \r\ninterest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in \r\nfuture).\r\n1.7 Moving House\r\nIt is possible to move to a different Property, under the terms of the scheme (please see More 2 Life\u2019s "}
{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128500", "filename": "128500/63.pdf", "page_num": 8, "text": "5\r\nGAR0392/001.0/Natasha WakefieldTerms and Conditions at Section 1 paragraph 7). provided that the Property you want to move to is \r\nacceptable to More 2 Life.  However, this is not guaranteed.  Examples of where More 2 Life may not \r\nagree to transfer the mortgage to another Property might include a flat, where the lease does not \r\nhave enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the Property is of non-standard construction.\r\nIf More 2 Life is agreeable to \u201cporting\u201d (ie, transferring) your mortgage to a new Property, and your \r\nplanned new home is of a lower value than your current home, you may be required to repay some of \r\nthe loan.  No early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances. If you intend to move home \r\nand wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve More 2 Life from the outset.  The \r\nsolicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors at all stages to ensure \r\nthat More 2 Life is satisfied as to the title of the new Property and is willing to (continue to) lend.  \r\nOnly once More 2 Life has confirmed that it is satisfied with the new Property, will their solicitors \r\nprovide your solicitors authority to exchange.  You must not progress the transaction to a stage where \r\nyou are contractually obliged to purchase the new Property without More 2 Life\u2019s consent.\r\nIf your proposed new Property is acceptable to More 2 Life  and you decide to repay the loan, you \r\nmay attract an early repayment charge.\r\nIf your proposed new home does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the \r\nmortgage, no early repayment charge will apply. Furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your \r\nloan in full as a result of the first borrower dying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to \r\ndo so without early repayment charge.\r\nYou should always obtain More 2 Life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any \r\nsignificant expenditure in the event that this is not possible.\r\n1.8 Sale of Part of the Property \r\nIf you are seeking to sell part of the Property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell More 2 \r\nLife and seek More 2 Life\u2019s prior consent in accordance with part 2, section 4.13 of the Terms and \r\nConditions.  If the sale of part of the Property reduces its value, it is likely that you may be required to \r\nrepay some of the loan. \r\n1.9 Taxation on the Loan\r\nThe loan is tax-free under present legislation. \r\nWhilst it would be unusual, it is possible that new legislation may change the taxation rules and \r\ngovernments can apply any new rules retrospectively.  If such a change occurred, you may have to \r\npay tax even though your loan may have come into effect many years before the change in tax \r\nposition.  However, this is unlikely.\r\nWhat will it cost to set up?\r\n2.1 Financial Adviser\u2019s Fee\r\nWe have been advised by Viva Retirement Solutions that fees of \u00a3750.00 have been agreed between \r\nyou.  We will pay this amount directly to Viva Retirement Solutions from your completion funds.  \r\n2.2 Legal Fees\r\nYou are responsible for Equilaw\u2019s fees, disbursements and VAT of \u00a3699.00, as detailed in our initial \r\nestimate, together with any further correspondence we have sent to you to agree additional fees for \r\nextra work, as applicable."}

We \r\nare not usually notified of these costs until we receive the provisional completion statement that is \r\nprovided with the intended completion date.  We will always make you aware of any additional \r\ndisbursements as soon as we are made aware. \r\nThe costs can be as follows (unless this is a purchase or first registration):-\r\nPossible disbursements (where they apply) \r\nRegistration fee for first registration Variable as per HMLR Fee Scale \r\nCopy lease or other deed \u00a33 each \r\nK15 \u00a32 each name \r\nOS2 \u00a33 per title\r\nYour obligations and what you have agreed to do \r\n3.1 Borrowing\r\nYou have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. any existing mortgage you may have) from the \r\nproceeds of the equity release funds and you cannot use the Property as security for any further \r\nborrowing; unless More 2 Life gives its written permission, which is unlikely.\r\n3.2 Who can live in the Property?\r\nOnly the people named in the Mortgage Offer can live at the Property, subject to the paragraph \r\ntitle \"Moving a New Person into the Property\" below.  \r\n3.3 Moving a new person into the Property\r\nIf you want somebody else to move into The Property, you must seek More 2 Life\u2019s authority to do \r\nso.  The new occupier will be required to sign More 2 Life's Occupier's Waiver form and may require \r\nindependent legal advice. You or the occupier will be responsible for the legal fees before they \r\nmove in.\r\nPlease note that More 2 Life states that, once this mortgage is completed, you cannot add another \r\nborrower.  As such, if you wanted to change the ownership of the Property, you\u2019d need to pay back \r\nMore 2 Life first (eg, by re-mortgaging) as a new person cannot be added to this particular \r\nmortgage. If you do this within the early repayment term, you will incur an early repayment \r\npenalty.\r\n3.4 Residence\r\nThis must be your permanent residence (i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your \r\npossessions). If you are planning to leave the Property empty for 3 months or longer, you must \r\ninform More 2 Life of your intention, and seek its permission to do so in accordance with the Terms \r\nand Conditions.  \r\nIt is important that you do this so that More 2 Life does not consider you to have moved out \r\npermanently (in accordance with its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale \r\nof the Property and repayment of the loan, potentially incurring early redemption charges.  \r\nYou must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the Property.  \r\nUsually this is a requirement if you are planning to leave the Property empty for 30 days or more.\r\n3.5 You can live in the Property for as long as you either want or need to (if you do not breach any of \r\nthe mortgage conditions).  Please carefully read the Terms and Conditions paying particular \r\nattention to the legal definitions (including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and \r\ndefault.  "}

More 2 Life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it \r\ndecides to inspect (except in cases of emergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse.  This is an \r\nentirely standard condition in most residential mortgages please see Part 2 section 4.4 of the Terms \r\nand Conditions.\r\n3.7 Repair & Maintenance\r\nYou have agreed to keep the Property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not \r\nadversely affected by allowing it to fall into disrepair.\r\nIf More 2 Life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be \r\nundertaken, this must be done within the time stipulated or More 2 Life is entitled to send its own \r\nworkmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it.  If you cannot (or do not) reimburse More \r\n2 Life for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage and interest \r\nthen added to it, which will compound and roll up.\r\nPlease also note that if you do not keep the Property in reasonable condition, the no-negative \r\nequity guarantee would not extend to these costs and charges. Please see section 6 of the offer and \r\nsection 2, paragraphs.4.2 and 13 of the Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.8 Insurance\r\nYou must keep the Property fully insured, by a company approved by More 2 Life, for all usual and \r\ncomprehensive risks to restore the Property, to its present condition. If it is damaged or destroyed \r\nthe cover should include cover for demolition, site clearance and architect\u2019s plans to rebuild the \r\nProperty. The reinstatement sum insured must be no less than \u00a3400,000.00, as stated in your \r\nMortgage Offer. If your policy is not index-linked then you must ensure The Property is insured for \r\nat least 10% more than the amount recommended by More 2 Life.\r\nYou must ensure that More 2 Life is noted as an interested party on the policy. (i.e that The \r\nProperty insurance is in the joint names of yourself and \u201cMore 2 Life Equity Release Ltd\u201d).  We will \r\nrequire sight of the new insurance policy immediately after completion, to enable us to check it \r\nmeets More 2 Life\u2019s requirements.\r\nMore 2 Life may require you to produce a copy of your buildings insurance from time to time to \r\ncheck that you are adequately covered.  If the level of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is \r\nindex-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. A copy will be required for \r\ncompletion, and therefore please send it to us, if you have not already done so.\r\nIf you do not insure the Property, More 2 Life will do this for you but will re-charge the cost of the \r\ninsurance premium to you. You must pay these sums on demand and please be aware that the \r\ninsurance will be to protect More 2 Life's interest and therefore may not be suitable for your own \r\nrequirements. We recommend that you always source your own suitable insurance and keep up to \r\ndate with the premiums to avoid More 2 Life stepping in.\r\nIf an insurable event occurs (e.g. a fire or flood), you must immediately inform More 2 Life. More 2 \r\nLife has the right to negotiate with the insurer on your behalf.  Any monies paid under the \r\ninsurance policy will be held by you on trust for More 2 Life and must be used to make good the \r\nloss and damage. More 2 Life can elect, acting reasonably, to use any proceeds of such a claim to \r\nreduce or repay the total debt owing, instead of rebuilding the Property. It would be unlikely for \r\nMore 2 Life to do this, unless it was wholly impractical or impossible to facilitate the rebuild of the \r\nProperty. Please review Section 2, paragraphs 4.8 and 4.9 of the Terms and Conditions for further \r\ndetails. "}

It is also likely that \r\nthese persons will deal with the administration of your estate, including the repayment of this loan, \r\nonce you have passed away or if you have left the Property to move into long term care.  They will \r\nneed to notify More 2 Life of this event and be aware of More 2 Life\u2019s requirements regarding \r\nrepayment of the loan.\r\n3.10 Legal Notice, Orders or Proposals effecting the Property.\r\nYou must immediately inform More 2 Life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to \r\nthe Property.\r\n3.11 Alterations to the Property\r\nYou must seek More 2 Life's permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the \r\nProperty (eg, new basement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require \r\nplanning consent and/or building regulations approval)  This is an additional requirement and we \r\nstrongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for planning consent or building \r\nregulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from More 2 Life in principle as, \r\nif it refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work.  Lenders do not usually \r\nwithhold consent unreasonably, but there may be certain types of Property development which do \r\nnot fall within their lending criteria (and basements can often fall into this category), so it is better \r\nto be certain before committing to any projects.\r\nIf you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as Green \r\nDeal) you must first obtain the written permission of More 2 Life to do so (usually in case this is \r\nsecured against the Property, which is not allowed by More 2 Life).\r\n3.12 Acquiring additional land adjoining the Property\r\nIf you buy or acquire any land next to the Property, please notify More 2 Life.  More 2 Life may \r\nrequire you to extend the mortgage to cover include this piece of land.  This is because the new \r\npiece of land may be of strategic importance to the Property (e.g. for development) and the value \r\ncan be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. Please see Section 2, paragraph 4.14 \r\nof the Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.13 Renting out the Property\r\nYou cannot rent out the Property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself.  If you wish to do so, \r\nplease contact More 2 Life to discuss your options.\r\nIf More 2 Life does not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a \u201cBuy to Let\u201d product.  \r\nYour financial adviser will be able to assist you and talk you through the costs of doing so.\r\n3.14 Business Use\r\nYou cannot use The Property for business purposes.  If you wish to do so you must contact More 2 \r\nLife to seek its permission which may be refused. As such, if this is something that you are likely to \r\nwant to do, you should speak to your financial adviser now to understand your options.\r\n3.15 Impact on Benefits\r\nReceipt of the loan may reduce (or may remove entirely) any current or future entitlement to \r\nmeans-tested State benefits, such as Pension Credit or Council Tax benefits.  If you think you may \r\nbe entitled to any such benefits, OR you receive means-tested benefits already, please speak to \r\nyour financial adviser before proceeding as you may be appreciably worse off if you do not explore \r\nyour options in advance of taking up this equity release.\r\n3.16 Special Conditions Imposed by More 2 Life"}

Please contact your insurance provider to effect this change. Once \r\nyou have done so, please forward a copy of the insurance schedule to us in order to satisfy this \r\nrequirement.\r\nWhen does the loan have to be repaid? \r\n4.1 The loan contract ends if and when: \r\n\uf0b7the last owner of the Property dies, goes into long-term care (which may be either \r\nsheltered accommodation or residential nursing care according to the definition of \r\n\u201cPayment Date\u201d in the Terms and Conditions, which you should read carefully) and \r\nexplains what is regarded as long-term care; or\r\n\uf0b7you purchase another Property and the loan cannot be ported; or\r\n\uf0b7the Property is permanently abandoned (please see the definition of \u201cPayment Date\u201d in \r\nthe Terms and Conditions); or\r\n\uf0b7you are declared bankrupt; or\r\n\uf0b7you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in Section 1, paragraph 9 \r\nTerms & Conditions\r\nThe amount to repay will include the capital borrowed, plus all rolled-up interest and any costs \r\nincurred by More 2 Life (for example repair costs). \r\nThe term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 8 of your Mortgage Offer is 15 years.  This \r\ndoes not mean the mortgage comes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and \r\nthe overall repayment amount will increase the longer it runs.\r\n4.2 Impact of Loan ending due to Death or long term care\r\nIf the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then More 2 Life may request medical or \r\nother specialist evidence of the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused.\r\nThe term will also end on the last borrower's death. No early repayment charges will be payable in \r\nthese circumstances, but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (again, \r\nusually when the Property is sold).\r\n4.3 Sale of the Property \r\nYou or your Attorney (if you have appointed one under a Power of Attorney) or Personal \r\nRepresentatives (if you have died) will have a maximum of 12 months to sell the Property following \r\nthe last borrower entering into long term care or dying.  If the Property is not sold within 12 months \r\nMore 2 Life may take over conduct of the sale.  This would usually be if More 2 Life perceived no \r\nprogress was being made and that this was unreasonable in the circumstances.\r\n4.4 Bankruptcy and/or Breach of Material Contract Terms\r\nThe loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the \r\nTerms and Conditions, specifically your obligations as set out in Section 1, paragraph 9 and Section \r\n2, paragraph 4 of the Terms and Conditions, including being declared bankrupt.  Please note that \r\nearly repayment charges are applicable in these circumstances.\r\n4.5 Early Repayment Charges.\r\nEarly repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the Terms and \r\nConditions."}

However, if you chose to do this prior \r\nto the 15 year early redemption penalty period, you may incur an early repayment charge.\r\nThe early repayment charge is calculated by reference to the anniversary of the completion date:\r\n\uf0b7up to the 1st anniversary the charge is 10% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 2nd anniversary the charge is 9% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 3rd anniversary the charge is 8% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 4th anniversary the charge is 7% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 5th anniversary the charge is 6% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 6th anniversary the charge is 5% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 7th anniversary the charge is 4% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 8th anniversary the charge is 3% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 9th anniversary the charge is 2% of the amount repaid;\r\n\uf0b7up to the 15th anniversary the charge is 1% of the amount repaid;\r\nAfter 15th anniversary is no charge.\r\n4.6 Exemption from Early Repayment Charges\r\nNo Early repayment penalty will be charged if:\r\n\uf0b7you or the last surviving borrower requires long term care or dies;\r\n\uf0b7after 5 years from the anniversary of the completion, you move to a new house and your \r\nnew property does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria;\r\n\uf0b7the total debt is repaid/reduced using funds from an insurance company following damage \r\nto the Property;\r\n\uf0b7you make a voluntary partial repayment;\r\n\uf0b7the lifetime mortgage is repaid by remaining borrower within 3 years of the death or \r\nrequirement for long term care of first borrower;\r\n\uf0b7the cash faciity is withdrawn; or\r\n\uf0b7you downsize to a lower value Property and are requested to make a partial repayment.\r\n4.7 Voluntary Partial Early Repayments\r\nMore 2 Life allows partial repayments to be made without any early repayment charge:\r\n\uf0b7Maximum payment of 10% of the total cash advanced within each 12 month period \r\nfollowing completion; and\r\n\uf0b7Minimum payment of \u00a350; and\r\n\uf0b7Maximum of twelve payments in a 12 month period\r\nPlease note if you pay more than the 10% allowance, an early repayment charge will apply (if this is \r\nwithin the early repayment term).  Where you do make partial repayments, it will reduce the level \r\nof loan and therefore the compounding effect of interest rolling up over time. \r\nIf you intend to make a Voluntary Partial Repayment, please ensure that you contact More 2 Life \r\nbefore you make it.\r\nAny proportion of the permitted voluntary partial repayments amount that is unused cannot be \r\ncarried forward into the next 12-month period."}

You have the option to repay in \r\nfull, should you so wish, subject to the Early Repayment calculation as set out above.\r\n5.5 Subject to you complying with the Terms and Conditions, More 2 Life offers a no-negative equity \r\nguarantee, so that you (or your estate) will never owe more than the value of the Property, even if \r\nthe level of the loan has out-stripped the value of the remaining equity in the Property.  \r\nWhat are the disadvantages?\r\n6.1 Means-tested State benefits, such as Pension Credit or Council Tax benefits may be affected.  You \r\nshould therefore check your entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) \r\nbefore proceeding with this loan.\r\n6.2 The loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in The Property over time, \r\nespecially where no voluntary repayments are made, and particularly if house prices do not rise and \r\nyou have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the value of The Property.\r\n6.3 Further loans against the Property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans \r\nwill be permitted by More 2 Life while its loan is still in existence.  A further advance from More 2 \r\nLife (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your individual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the \r\nremaining equity in The Property.\r\n6.4 If you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt, the Property can be repossessed (see \r\nSection 1, paragraph 9 of the Terms and Conditions).\r\n6.5 This is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply, should you wish to redeem the \r\nloan early (or if the Property is repossessed). For your peace of mind, More 2 Life has set a \r\nmaximum figure which can be charged of \u00a35,341.23, which allows you to conduct a \u201ccost versus \r\nbenefit\u201d assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging.\r\nThe calculation of the charges is as set out in section 13 of your Mortgage Offer."}

This may incur early repayment charges.  If you are deemed \r\nto be in default, the no-negative equity guarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by More \r\n2 Life as a result of the breaches.\r\nMore 2 Life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach.\r\nRepossession would always be a matter of last resort.\r\n7.2 If you move to a new house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on the \r\ncircumstances.\r\n  \r\n7.3 Further additional secured borrowing from More 2 Life is not guaranteed. In addition, the drawdown \r\nfacility can be removed without notice by More 2 Life at any time without prior notice.\r\n7.4 If you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment \r\npenalty will apply if you wish to re-mortgage with another lender.\r\n7.5 If the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you \r\nowe tax on the lump sum that you have taken, albeit unlikely.\r\n7.6 If you do not make any voluntary interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost \r\nof this interest plus the capital of the loan will erode the equity available in the Property in due \r\ncourse, particularly if the value of the Property does not go up over time.  This means that you would \r\nnot be able to leave the Property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your Wills, but you can leave \r\nany remaining equity once the Property has been sold.\r\n7.7 Eligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely affected. \r\n7.8 Any existing charge secured against the Property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your \r\nequity release plan, which will reduce the amount you receive on completion.\r\n7.9 If your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively \r\nconverting this into a debt secured against The Property, which is enforceable if you default by \r\nrepossession.  You should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that \r\nthis is the best course of action for you.  \r\nReward:\r\n7.10 You will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use.\r\n7.11 There is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than \r\nthe value of The Property (provided there are no material breaches of the Terms and Conditions). \r\n7.12 You can potentially \u201cport\u201d this mortgage to a new Property if you want to move to a new house."}

If you are willing to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive \r\nto outweigh the risks involved, the next step is to arrange an appointment to complete and sign the \r\nrequired documentation.  If you are still unsure, or we can clarify any aspect for you, please do not \r\nhesitate to telephone Natasha Wakefield.  \r\nYou should keep this report for future reference.\r\n8.2 Appointment \r\nIn order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully.  It \r\nis a matter of law that the deed MUST be executed in the physical presence of an independent \r\nperson.  The Equity Release Council (\"ERC\") guidelines require this to be a solicitor.\r\nWe note that you would like to have your solicitor's appointment at home with a local solicitor. Please \r\ncontact Natasha Wakefield  to arrange a Solicitors appointment date, it would be helpful if you could \r\nreview your diary in preparation for this telephone call and, if possible, reschedule any non-critical \r\nappointments, as our home visit solicitors are not in your area every day. Due to the nature of their \r\nrole, which entails driving to each appointment, we will book your appointment on the next \r\nconvenient and available day and then contact you by text the day before to give you the \r\napproximate time that our solicitor will arrive which will be within a one hour window, enabling you \r\nto arrange your day around your appointment. If you have not heard from us by 3.00pm please call us \r\non 01452 376702. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the \r\nappointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every \r\nendeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because our solicitors travel many miles each \r\nday visiting clients, occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions, traffic, accidents \r\nor other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment.  \r\nThe attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation \r\nand not to provide you with any legal advice.  Legal advice is provided by us within this \u201cMortgage \r\nReport\u201d.  If you have any questions or queries arising from this report, please direct these to Natasha \r\nWakefield in advance of the appointment. \r\nIn preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed Document Checklist and ensure that all of \r\ndocuments listed are available.  If any documents are missing, please contact Natasha Wakefield prior \r\nto the appointment so we can arrange for any replacement documents to be sent to you in readiness.  \r\nIf the missing documents are those in your care and control, but are unavailable, please telephone \r\nNatasha Wakefield so that we can discuss how best to proceed.\r\nWe anticipate that the Solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. Please note that only \r\nthe equity release applicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. The solicitor will need \r\nto verify your identity at the appointment and take copies of the documentation provided.  Please \r\nensure you have:\r\n\uf0b7Valid photographic signature identification: i.e Passport, Driving Licence, National Identity \r\nCard AND Address verification: i.e bank statement;\r\n\uf0b7Utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current Council \r\nTax Bill naming each borrower.\r\nVery occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your \r\ninitial signing appointment.  To minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via Skype or Facetime.  \r\nIf you are not able to access this via your own (or a family/friends\u2019) mobile device, or via public \r\ncomputers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local solicitor who will charge \u00a35 per "}

If this is required. we will notify you and provide our Skype/Facetime \r\naddress at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. \r\n8.3 Cost of the Solicitor Appointment\r\nThe costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute \r\nmeeting.  If you cancel or fail to attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') \r\nnotice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to be met.  If the appointment is no longer \r\nconvenient, please contact us as a matter of urgency.  \r\n8.4 Identification\r\nWe must provide a \u201cguarantee\u201d of your identity to More 2 Life at the point of requesting the funds.  \r\nIn order to be able to give this guarantee, we will need valid photographic identity evidence i.e a \r\ndriving licence or signed passport.  If you do not have such identification, then we will require a \r\nphotograph certified by an acceptable counter-signatory confirming your identity.  \r\nPlease see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter-\r\nsignatories.  Please contact Natasha Wakefield to obtain a form for your counter-signatory to \r\ncomplete which will then satisfy More 2 Lifes required guarantee.\r\nAdditionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and Mortgage Offer must match exactly.  \r\nIf there is a name discrepancy, we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your \r\nbirth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s). We will require the original(s) but will return these to \r\nyou immediately. \r\nIf there is an address discrepancy, we will need multiple address verification including: your most \r\nrecent council tax invoice AND a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, \r\nor a DWP pension letter.\r\nIf you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or \r\ndiscrepancy to resolve, please let Natasha Wakefield in advance of the appointment, so that we can \r\ninstruct your attending solicitor to obtain all necessary documentation.\r\n8.5 Next Steps\r\nOnce we have received your signed documentation, we endeavour to send all documentation to \r\nMore 2 Life\u2019s solicitor within 2 working days by guaranteed next day special delivery.   We can only \r\nforward these documents when all required conditions have been satisfied and all documentation \r\nreceived. \r\nPlease ensure the Document Checklist has been fully completed.\r\nOn a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or \r\nsubsequent correspondence) we estimate that completion will take place within approximately 11 \r\nworking days.   This timescale is only an estimate and is not guaranteed.  As such, we strongly \r\nrecommend that you do not commit/spend the proceeds until we confirm completion is taking place, \r\nwhich we will do by telephone in advance.\r\nIf your case has any additional elements, we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, \r\nbecause we are often waiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and \r\nimpossible to guarantee.  Natasha Wakefield will keep you up to date with progress on your case.\r\nWe will endeavour to secure the earliest possible completion date (if that is what you would like) but \r\nif there is any particular urgency attaching to your case, or significance around a date (including a \r\nneed to delay), please inform Natasha Wakefield so that we can do our best to meet your \r\nexpectations."}

It is extremely important that you are aware that \r\nyou MUST inform your lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including \r\nUkrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately breach the terms and \r\nconditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the \r\nsituation.  If the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can \r\npursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for Ukraine scheme \r\nand no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require \r\nhousing support for far longer than the initial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are \r\ntherefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in all \r\ncases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to \r\nrefugees, please let us know immediately. \r\nTax or Financial advice\r\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose \r\nof the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability, we strongly advise that you seek independent \r\ntax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about \r\ngiving away the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your \r\npreferred (or required) outcome.\r\nCharges\r\nIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid \r\nany delays to your Equity Release.\r\nPlease do not cancel any direct debits/standing orders until after completion. Any overpayment \r\nmade will be refunded by your current lender. If you cancel your direct debit/standing order before \r\ncompletion it may cause the amount repaid to be insufficient to clear the existing debt and this \r\nwould then prevent your Equity Release Lender from securing their charge over the property.  This is \r\nin breach of their terms and conditions. \r\nFees and Expenses\r\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-\r\ninclusive fee of \u00a3699. The all-inclusive fee is based on the assumption that your case is straight-\r\nforward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors \r\nsigning appointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\r\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the \r\nassumption that your equity release transaction has no unusual features. Should your case have any \r\nadditional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to \r\nresolve. Our additional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional \r\nwork is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's requirement. Any additional fee \r\nwork is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the \r\nadditional charge remains payable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity \r\nRelease funds."}

These fraudsters have \r\nrealised that millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or \r\nphone call containing bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this \r\nmoney by a combination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of \r\nmoney to the fraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever \r\nrecovered, and the solicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is \r\nincreasingly prevalent.  \r\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their \r\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  \r\nEqually we cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such \r\nunlawful interception. \r\nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact \r\ndetails, published by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  \r\nOur Head Office telephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, \r\nespecially if you receive any unexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a \r\nchange in contact details here. \r\nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts \r\ninvolved exceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\r\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you \r\nmay send us any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document \r\nand this will establish a payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\r\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other \r\nbank account without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds \r\nto any third party directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any \r\noutstanding mortgage balances (if appropriate).

Office hours are 9.00 am to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, \r\nalthough arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\r\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\r\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will \r\nconfirm this in writing.  We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of \r\nengagement, together with their direct dial telephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  \r\nWe aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day and to respond to written communications \r\nwithin two working days.  \r\nYour Responsibilities\r\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about \r\nyour matter at the outset, so that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide \r\nus with full contact details: mobile/home/work telephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new \r\ninformation becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances change.  Where we act for more than one \r\nclient jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \r\nOur Charges\r\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis \r\non which we will charge you. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to \r\ndo and a list of the money we may have to pay out on your behalf (disbursements).  \r\nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility \r\nthat we have been notified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change \r\nthe work you have asked us to do, that no additional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that \r\nthe work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the scope of work agreed in the engagement letter, \r\nand that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your work within the overall \r\ncost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete \r\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will \r\nremain liable for the work done, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees \r\nschedule that may be found in the supplement to this document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if \r\nwe have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is freehold, and it transpires that the property is \r\nleasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed that our own fees \r\nmay be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity \r\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for \r\nthese costs.\r\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\r\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel \r\nthe appointment giving less than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action \r\nor inaction to schedule a further appointment, we will charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment \r\nand we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that \u2018working day\u2019 in this context means \r\nMonday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. \r\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of \r\nyour equity release application this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your \r\napplication fails to complete the cost of the appointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment."}

Where this is necessary you will remain \r\nliable for the cost of the insurance cover required and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging \r\nyour indemnity insurance as shown in the additional fees schedule.\r\nShortfall\r\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against \r\nyour house, together with the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing \r\nplease note that we will need to undertake checks in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations 2019, and \r\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.

All interim \r\nstatute bills are due for payment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not \r\nproceed to completion should be made in sterling either by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank \r\naccount (details on request).  \r\nShortfalls and Completion Funds\r\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for \r\nshortfalls, ie. if you are borrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged \r\nunder the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019) to establish the source of any funds that are provided by you \r\nand we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We are happy to accept debit card \r\npayments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card unless in exceptional circumstances. \r\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\r\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with \r\ndeposits spread in order to help mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held \r\nqualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee scheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, \r\ntechnically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from the Inland Revenue\u2019s point of \r\nview, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any \r\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. "}

Why do you want it as well? \r\nWe are required, by your Lender\u2019s solicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering \r\nRegulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight of original government issued photographic identity \r\nevidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an Identify Verification Form should \r\nbe completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the attending \r\nsolicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to \r\nallow us to provide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\r\n3. I have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you? \r\nWe have to provide details to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do \r\nrequire a copy but are happy for your financial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance \r\nfor completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will delay your case if it expires prior to completion.\r\n4.Do I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation? \r\nYes.  The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key requirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as \r\na \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences of the Equity Release and to guarantee your \r\nidentity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring that they know what is \r\nrequired of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for \r\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, \r\nthat is our role, please refer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.  \r\n5. How do I book my solicitors appointment?\r\nDepending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an appointment day, or \r\nyou will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to \r\nyou within 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the \r\nsame number) a one hour time slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or \r\nhave not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day before appointment day) please contact us. Please make \r\nsure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to occur, in the event that our solicitor \r\narrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided but because \r\nour solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather \r\nconditions, traffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment.  \r\n6. I cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \r\nWe can almost always arrange for one of our mobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that \r\nwe cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you with a local solicitor.  You may wish to use \r\nyour own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent instructions prior to the \r\nappointment.  \r\n7. The solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\r\nPlease telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if a specific appointment day/time \r\nis required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\r\n8. Should we update our Wills at the same time?\r\nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or updated following any \r\nchange in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a \r\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, \r\nespecially if you have a drawdown product.  \r\n9.Why should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \r\nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or products and this lack of \r\nexperience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced \r\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client \r\nfeedback on webpage, Twitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards. \r\n10. When will you be in touch with me? \r\nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed (2) on receipt \r\nof your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) "}

If I/we fail to do so, I/we will \r\nimmediately breach the terms and conditions of my/our mortgage, for which the lender can \r\nrequest and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any loss as a \r\nresult of such an occupier moving in with me/us, they can pursue me/us for that loss.\r\n6.The interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost \r\nof this interest plus the capital of the loan could wipe out the whole of the value of our \r\nProperty in due course. This means that we would not be able to leave our Property or any \r\npart of it to beneficiaries under our Will."}

If I/we fail to do so, I/we will \r\nimmediately breach the terms and conditions of my/our mortgage, for which the lender can \r\nrequest and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any loss as a \r\nresult of such an occupier moving in with me/us, they can pursue me/us for that loss.\r\n6.The interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost \r\nof this interest plus the capital of the loan could wipe out the whole of the value of our \r\nProperty in due course. This means that we would not be able to leave our Property or any \r\npart of it to beneficiaries under our Will."}

These fraudsters have realised\r\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\r\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\r\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\r\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\r\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\r\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\r\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\r\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\r\ninterception. \r\nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\r\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\r\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\r\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \r\nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\r\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\r\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\r\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\r\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\r\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\r\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\r\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\r\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\r\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\r\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\r\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\r\nWhat should you be looking out for?\r\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\r\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\r\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\r\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\r\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\r\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\r\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\r\nHow can you protect yourself?\r\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\r\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\r\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\r\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\r\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\r\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!"}

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \nnot have\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\nForm.\nEnclosed is our \nFrequently Asked Questions\n sheet and \nCybercrime Leaflet\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\nnotify us to the contrary.\n \nScope of Work\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\nFinancial Adviser Key Retirement Solutions, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let\nme know so that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \nfirst and only\n legal charge (mortgage) to\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\n launched by the\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\nTax or Financial advice\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\n \nCharges\n \n \nFees and Expenses\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3899.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds."}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\n \nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\nIndemnity Insurance\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible."}

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\nmade.

Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due for\npayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \nShortfalls and Completion Funds\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)\nRegulation and limits on our services\nWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey\nreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the\nsuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance\nplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.

You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\n10. \nWhen will you be in touch with me? \nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next."}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\r\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \r\nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\r\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\r\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\r\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\r\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\r\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\r\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\r\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \r\nYour Responsibilities\r\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\r\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\r\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\r\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \r\nOur Charges\r\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\r\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\r\non your behalf (disbursements).  \r\nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\r\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\r\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\r\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\r\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\r\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\r\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\r\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\r\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\r\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\r\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\r\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\r\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\r\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\r\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\r\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\r\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\r\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\r\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\r\n \r\nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\r\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\r\nIndemnity Insurance\r\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\r\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\r\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\r\nthe additional fees schedule.\r\nShortfall\r\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\r\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\r\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\r\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\r\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\r\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\r\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\r\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible."}

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\r\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\r\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\r\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \r\nnot have\r\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\r\nForm.\r\nEnclosed is our \r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n sheet and \r\nCybercrime Leaflet\r\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\r\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\r\nnotify us to the contrary.\r\n \r\nScope of Work\r\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\r\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\r\nFinancial Adviser Key Retirement Solutions, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let\r\nme know so that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\r\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \r\nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\r\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\r\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \r\nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\r\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \r\nfirst and only\r\n legal charge (mortgage) to\r\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\r\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\r\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \r\nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\r\n launched by the\r\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\r\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\r\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\r\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\r\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\r\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\r\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\r\nTax or Financial advice\r\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\r\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\r\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\r\n \r\nCharges\r\n \r\n \r\nFees and Expenses\r\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3899.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\r\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\r\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\r\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\r\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\r\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\r\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\r\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\r\n2"}

As soon as we are aware of any we will notify you.\r\n \r\nMarketing Fees \r\nBoth Equilaw and Key Retirement Solutions\r\n \r\nspecialise in the equity release industry.

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\r\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \r\nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\r\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\r\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\r\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\r\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\r\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\r\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\r\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \r\nYour Responsibilities\r\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\r\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\r\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\r\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \r\nOur Charges\r\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\r\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\r\non your behalf (disbursements).  \r\nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\r\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\r\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\r\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\r\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\r\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\r\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\r\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\r\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\r\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\r\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\r\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\r\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\r\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\r\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\r\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\r\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\r\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\r\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\r\n \r\nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\r\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\r\nIndemnity Insurance\r\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\r\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\r\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\r\nthe additional fees schedule.\r\nShortfall\r\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\r\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\r\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\r\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\r\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\r\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\r\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\r\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible.\r\n12"}

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\r\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\r\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\r\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\r\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \r\nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\r\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\r\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\r\nmade.  Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for\r\nany errors or delays once the funds leave our account. Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\r\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\r\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due for\r\npayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\r\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \r\nShortfalls and Completion Funds\r\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\r\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\r\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\r\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\r\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\r\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\r\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\r\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\r\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\r\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \r\nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\r\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\r\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \r\nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\r\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\r\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\r\nthe nature of the transaction;\r\namounts held and their duration;\r\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\r\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\r\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)\r\nRegulation and limits on our services\r\nWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey\r\nreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the\r\nsuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance\r\nplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.  We can perform certain limited services in relation to\r\ninsurances and investments, provided they are closely linked with the legal services we are providing to you.  \r\nWe are not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) but we are included\r\non the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: LS 525526) so that we can carry on insurance mediation activity,\r\nwhich is broadly advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of our business, including arrangements for redress if\r\nsomething goes wrong, is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The register of exempt professional firms can be\r\naccessed via the Financial Conduct Authority website at: https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_Homepage\r\nThe Law Society of England and Wales is a designated professional body for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 but\r\nthe responsibility for regulation and complaints handling has been separated from the Law Society\u2019s representative functions.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128501", "filename": "128501/22.pdf", "page_num": 17, "text": "FAQ\r\n1. \r\nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \r\nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\r\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\r\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \r\nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\r\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \r\n2. \r\nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\r\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\r\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\r\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\r\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\r\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\r\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\r\n3. \r\nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\r\n We have to provide\r\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\r\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\r\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\r\n4. \r\nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\r\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\r\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\r\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\r\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\r\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\r\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\r\n5. \r\nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\r\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\r\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\r\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\r\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\r\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\r\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\r\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\r\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \r\n6. \r\nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \r\nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\r\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\r\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\r\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\r\n7. \r\nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\r\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\r\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\r\n8. \r\nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \r\nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\r\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\r\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\r\ndrawdown product. \r\n9. \r\nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \r\nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\r\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\r\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\r\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\r\n10. \r\nWhen will you be in touch with me? \r\nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\r\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\r\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\r\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.\r\n17"}

These fraudsters have realised\r\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\r\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\r\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\r\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\r\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\r\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\r\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\r\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\r\ninterception. \r\nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\r\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\r\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\r\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \r\nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\r\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\r\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\r\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\r\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\r\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\r\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\r\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\r\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\r\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\r\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\r\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\r\nWhat should you be looking out for?\r\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\r\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\r\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\r\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\r\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\r\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\r\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\r\nHow can you protect yourself?\r\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\r\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\r\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\r\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\r\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\r\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!\r\n23"}

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\r\naware of the possible consequences:\r\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\r\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\r\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\r\nseeking.\r\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\r\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\r\nthe gift.\r\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\r\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\r\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\r\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from Key Retirement Solutions and it may be that you have\r\nalready addressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release\r\nfunds, we recommend that you do so.  \r\nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable.

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\r\naware of the possible consequences:\r\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\r\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\r\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\r\nseeking.\r\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\r\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\r\nthe gift.\r\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\r\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\r\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\r\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from Key Retirement Solutions and it may be that you have\r\nalready addressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release\r\nfunds, we recommend that you do so.  \r\nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable.

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\r\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\r\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\r\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \r\nnot have\r\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\r\nForm.\r\nEnclosed is our \r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n sheet and \r\nCybercrime Leaflet\r\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\r\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\r\nnotify us to the contrary.\r\n \r\nScope of Work\r\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\r\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\r\nFinancial Adviser Key Retirement Solutions, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let\r\nme know so that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\r\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \r\nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\r\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\r\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \r\nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\r\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \r\nfirst and only\r\n legal charge (mortgage) to\r\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\r\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\r\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \r\nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\r\n launched by the\r\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\r\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\r\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\r\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\r\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\r\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\r\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\r\nTax or Financial advice\r\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\r\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\r\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\r\nCharges\r\n \r\n \r\nFees and Expenses\r\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3899.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\r\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\r\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\r\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\r\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\r\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\r\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\r\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\r\nDisbursements\r\nDisbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control."}

We are: \r\nclosely following Public Health England and NHS guidance,  \r\nasking our attending solicitors to self-certify weekly that they have not (to the best of their knowledge) come into contact with any \u2018at risk\u2019\r\nindividuals,  \r\narranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; \r\nre-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; \r\nadapting our face to face meetings\r\n \r\nto be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; \r\nensuring that all staff are issued with PPE and sanitiser. \r\nWe believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the ERC Guidelines, adhere to the Law of\r\nProperty Act requirements, adhere to the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. \r\nIf you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know.

As the action rests with More 2 Life\u2019s\r\nsolicitors to carry out their pre-completion checks we cannot give a precise time estimate.\r\nOur final bill and completion statement will be sent to you following completion.  We will pay your net funds directly into your bank account by BACS in\r\nthree days. If you wish to obtain your funds on the same day as completion we are able to offer a premium same day service if at an additional cost of \u00a340\r\n+VAT.  Please notify us if you do want to upgrade to the premium payment service and we will amend our records, but please note that funds are usually\r\nnot received from the lenders solicitors until mid-afternoon on the day of completion, such that same day transfer to you is not always possible. There are\r\ncertain parts of the transaction where we must use same day bank transfer, for example, paying off an existing charge and this is beyond our control.\r\n "}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\n \nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\nIndemnity Insurance\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible."}
{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128502", "filename": "128502/13.pdf", "page_num": 2, "text": "Billing and Payment\nAll final bills are due for payment on delivery.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\nmade.  Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for\nany errors or delays once the funds leave our account. Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due for\npayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \nShortfalls and Completion Funds\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128502", "filename": "128502/13.pdf", "page_num": 6, "text": "FAQ\n1. \nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\n10. \nWhen will you be in touch with me? \nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next."}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\r\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \r\nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\r\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\r\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\r\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\r\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\r\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\r\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\r\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \r\nYour Responsibilities\r\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\r\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\r\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\r\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \r\nOur Charges\r\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\r\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\r\non your behalf (disbursements).  \r\nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\r\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\r\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\r\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\r\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\r\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\r\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\r\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\r\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\r\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\r\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\r\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\r\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\r\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\r\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\r\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\r\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\r\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\r\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\r\n \r\nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\r\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\r\nIndemnity Insurance\r\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\r\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\r\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\r\nthe additional fees schedule.\r\nShortfall\r\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\r\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\r\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\r\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\r\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\r\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\r\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\r\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible."}

These fraudsters have realised\r\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\r\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\r\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\r\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\r\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\r\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\r\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\r\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\r\ninterception. \r\nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\r\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\r\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\r\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \r\nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\r\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\r\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\r\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\r\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\r\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\r\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\r\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\r\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\r\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\r\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\r\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\r\nWhat should you be looking out for?\r\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\r\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\r\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\r\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\r\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\r\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\r\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\r\nHow can you protect yourself?\r\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\r\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\r\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\r\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\r\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\r\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!"}

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\r\naware of the possible consequences:\r\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\r\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\r\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\r\nseeking.\r\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\r\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\r\nthe gift.\r\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\r\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\r\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\r\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from UK Moneyman and it may be that you have already\r\naddressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we\r\nrecommend that you do so.  \r\nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. Once you have\r\ncompleted the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. Please be aware that I will not be able to\r\ncomplete your equity release until I am in receipt of a completed and signed form.\r\n \r\nPlease contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand or if you would like to discuss\r\nin more detail.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nOliver Honer\r\noliver.honer@equilaw.uk.com\r\nTo book a call with me visit callbooking.equilaw.uk.com/OliverHoner\r\n "}

As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\r\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\r\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \r\nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\r\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \r\nfirst and only\r\n legal charge (mortgage) to\r\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\r\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\r\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \r\nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\r\n launched by the\r\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\r\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\r\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\r\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\r\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\r\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\r\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\r\nTax or Financial advice\r\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\r\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\r\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\r\nCharges\r\n \r\n \r\nFees and Expenses\r\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3699.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\r\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\r\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\r\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\r\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\r\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\r\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\r\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\r\nDisbursements\r\nDisbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control."}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\n \nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\nIndemnity Insurance\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible.\n11"}

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\nmade.  Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for\nany errors or delays once the funds leave our account. Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due for\npayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \nShortfalls and Completion Funds\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)\nRegulation and limits on our services\nWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey\nreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the\nsuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance\nplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.  We can perform certain limited services in relation to\ninsurances and investments, provided they are closely linked with the legal services we are providing to you.  \nWe are not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) but we are included\non the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: LS 525526) so that we can carry on insurance mediation activity,\nwhich is broadly advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of our business, including arrangements for redress if\nsomething goes wrong, is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The register of exempt professional firms can be\naccessed via the Financial Conduct Authority website at: https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_Homepage\nThe Law Society of England and Wales is a designated professional body for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 but\nthe responsibility for regulation and complaints handling has been separated from the Law Society\u2019s representative functions.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128502", "filename": "128502/25.pdf", "page_num": 16, "text": "FAQ\n1. \nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\n10. \nWhen will you be in touch with me? \nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.\n16"}

These fraudsters have realised\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\ninterception. \nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\nWhat should you be looking out for?\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\nHow can you protect yourself?\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!\n24"}

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\naware of the possible consequences:\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\nseeking.\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\nthe gift.\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from UK Moneyman and it may be that you have already\naddressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we\nrecommend that you do so.  \nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. Once you have\ncompleted the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. Please be aware that I will not be able to\ncomplete your equity release until I am in receipt of a completed and signed form.\n \nPlease contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand or if you would like to discuss\nin more detail.\nYours sincerely,\nOliver Honer\noliver.honer@equilaw.uk.com\nTo book a call with me visit callbooking.equilaw.uk.com/OliverHoner\n \n25"}

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \nnot have\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\nForm.\nIn order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your \nexact\n bank details otherwise the banking system will\nreject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you.  In order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent\nbank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment.\nEnclosed is our \nFrequently Asked Questions\n sheet and \nCybercrime Leaflet\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\nnotify us to the contrary.\n \nScope of Work\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\nFinancial Adviser HUB Financial Solutions, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let me\nknow so that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \nfirst and only\n legal charge (mortgage) to\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\n launched by the\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\nTax or Financial advice\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\nCharges\nIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your Equity Release.\nFees and Expenses\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3600.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\nHUB Financial Services are paying your legal fees, so the enclosed estimated invoice is for your information only however, should any additional work be\nrequired in order to satisfy the lenders requirements you will be responsible for those fees, which we will deduct from the balance of your fees on"}

As soon as we are aware of any we will notify you.\nAdditional Works \u2013\n Occupiers\nIt is a condition of the transaction that you must obtain a clear legal title to the property without any other person having rights of occupation over the\nproperty which have priority to any claim which the product provider may make in the future to obtain possession and to sell it free from any rights of\npossession, there will be an additional fee to write to your occupiers of \u00a355.00 plus VAT per occupier.\nYour occupier will be sent an Occupier Waiver Deed by us once the Equity Release offer is issued by your lender.  This document is issued by your Lender\nand as such we are unable to amend or vary the form in any way, other than correct any spelling mistakes.  Each lender has slightly different requirements\nand please be aware that the document \nmay \nstate the Equity Release loan amount.  If your lender does state the value of the loan, this is not something\nthat they will agree to remove except in very rare and bespoke circumstances which must be referred to the Lender for their specific authority.\nIf the provision of this information to your Occupier is likely to cause difficulties such that you would prefer the loan amount not to be on the Occupiers\nWaiver Form, please contact me to discuss the reasons for this which I will then raise with the Lender\u2019s and their solicitors directly.  Please do this at the\nearliest opportunity as completion will not be set without the completed Occupiers Waiver form and often Lender\u2019s may need to take instruction from\ntheir funders and/or their insurers as to whether they can vary the agreed format document.  This can take a number of weeks\nYour occupier \nmay\n require ILA and we suggest sourcing a suitable solicitor now, so that an appointment can then be booked in as soon as we receive your\nmortgage offer which will also contain \u2019s requirements regarding your occupier and the relevant document for your occupier(s).\nUnregistered Land\nIn England and Wales there are two systems operating to prove ownership of property. Under the Land Registration Act 2002 it became mandatory for all\nland to be registered (when a specific event occurred e.g. sale or re-mortgage), however there remain a small proportion of properties which have not yet\nbeen become registered.  I have searched the Land Registry for your property and it appears that it may be unregistered.  If you believe it is registered\nplease contact me with your title number.\nIf your property is unregistered I require the (complete) original title deeds, evidencing your ownership and any benefits or rights that affect your property\nin order to progress your Equity Release.  The deeds must be sent by us to the Lender\u2019s solicitors to prove ownership and to be registered with the Land\nRegistry on completion.  Once your property is \"Registered\" the \u201cdeeds\u201d become obsolete as the Land Registry electronic record describes the land, its\nowners, any rights/restrictions affecting it and there is a detailed plan of the boundaries,  The Government \u201cguarantees\u201d that the record is accurate for any\nfuture transactions.\nPlease send your deeds back to me as soon as possible, or if you do not have them please identify their whereabouts to me.  I recommend keeping copies\nof the deeds and, when sending your originals that you do this via special recorded delivery.\nThere is a Land Registry fee payable by you for first registration.  The fee is tapered according to your property\u2019s value, which I will confirm once I have\nyour equity release offer which contains the current property valuation.\nIf you are unable to find your deeds please let me know as soon as possible. \nIf your deeds have been lost it is possible to reconstitute your deeds, but this is a time consuming (and additional cost) process which will delay your Equity\nRelease whilst your property is registered.  Lenders will not proceed until it is proven that you own the property. \nApplication for First Registration take approximately 4 months (from application) to registration.\nWe recognise that the deeds have historic interest to you and we always request their return, but the Land Registry default approach is to destroy the\ndeeds (as they are now defunct for the purposes of proving your ownership) and they are not always returned to us.  When/if the deeds are returned to us\nwe will return them to you.\nMy fees for the additional work are on request.\nSigned Plan\nPlease find enclosed a plan, obtained from the Land Registry, outlining what I believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return\nto me.  If the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent.  It is important that the plan is accurate. If you own any additional land, please\nidentify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct.\nNext Steps\nPlease review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to\nenable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to Equilaw such as account details for existing charges,\ndetails of any occupiers or your management company (if Leasehold) details.  On receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer\nthrough to completion. The offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lender\u2019s solicitors (who will then send it to us).\nWe will issue and send you a \"\nLegal Report Pack\". \nThis pack will come directly from Equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you will\nreceive from JUST directly.\nOffers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. We will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from JUST's solicitors."}

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \nnot have\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\nForm.\nIn order for the equity release funds to be paid directly into your bank account we will require your \nexact\n bank details otherwise the banking system will\nreject our payment, which will result in delay of receipt of the funds by you.  In order to ensure that the details are precise we request sight of a recent\nbank statement showing the bank account name, sort code and account number, which will be collected at the solicitors signing appointment.\nEnclosed is our \nFrequently Asked Questions\n sheet and \nCybercrime Leaflet\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\nnotify us to the contrary.\n \nScope of Work\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\nFinancial Adviser HUB Financial Solutions, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let me\nknow so that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \nfirst and only\n legal charge (mortgage) to\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\n launched by the\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\nTax or Financial advice\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\nCharges\nIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your Equity Release.\nFees and Expenses\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3600.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\nHUB Financial Services are paying your legal fees, so the enclosed estimated invoice is for your information only however, should any additional work be\nrequired in order to satisfy the lenders requirements you will be responsible for those fees, which we will deduct from the balance of your fees on\n2"}

As soon as we are aware of any we will notify you.\nAdditional Works \u2013\n Occupiers\nIt is a condition of the transaction that you must obtain a clear legal title to the property without any other person having rights of occupation over the\nproperty which have priority to any claim which the product provider may make in the future to obtain possession and to sell it free from any rights of\npossession, there will be an additional fee to write to your occupiers of \u00a355.00 plus VAT per occupier.\nYour occupier will be sent an Occupier Waiver Deed by us once the Equity Release offer is issued by your lender.  This document is issued by your Lender\nand as such we are unable to amend or vary the form in any way, other than correct any spelling mistakes.  Each lender has slightly different requirements\nand please be aware that the document \nmay \nstate the Equity Release loan amount.  If your lender does state the value of the loan, this is not something\nthat they will agree to remove except in very rare and bespoke circumstances which must be referred to the Lender for their specific authority.\nIf the provision of this information to your Occupier is likely to cause difficulties such that you would prefer the loan amount not to be on the Occupiers\nWaiver Form, please contact me to discuss the reasons for this which I will then raise with the Lender\u2019s and their solicitors directly.  Please do this at the\nearliest opportunity as completion will not be set without the completed Occupiers Waiver form and often Lender\u2019s may need to take instruction from\ntheir funders and/or their insurers as to whether they can vary the agreed format document.  This can take a number of weeks\nYour occupier \nmay\n require ILA and we suggest sourcing a suitable solicitor now, so that an appointment can then be booked in as soon as we receive your\nmortgage offer which will also contain \u2019s requirements regarding your occupier and the relevant document for your occupier(s).\nUnregistered Land\nIn England and Wales there are two systems operating to prove ownership of property. Under the Land Registration Act 2002 it became mandatory for all\nland to be registered (when a specific event occurred e.g. sale or re-mortgage), however there remain a small proportion of properties which have not yet\nbeen become registered.  I have searched the Land Registry for your property and it appears that it may be unregistered.  If you believe it is registered\nplease contact me with your title number.\nIf your property is unregistered I require the (complete) original title deeds, evidencing your ownership and any benefits or rights that affect your property\nin order to progress your Equity Release.  The deeds must be sent by us to the Lender\u2019s solicitors to prove ownership and to be registered with the Land\nRegistry on completion.  Once your property is \"Registered\" the \u201cdeeds\u201d become obsolete as the Land Registry electronic record describes the land, its\nowners, any rights/restrictions affecting it and there is a detailed plan of the boundaries,  The Government \u201cguarantees\u201d that the record is accurate for any\nfuture transactions.\nPlease send your deeds back to me as soon as possible, or if you do not have them please identify their whereabouts to me.  I recommend keeping copies\nof the deeds and, when sending your originals that you do this via special recorded delivery.\nThere is a Land Registry fee payable by you for first registration.  The fee is tapered according to your property\u2019s value, which I will confirm once I have\nyour equity release offer which contains the current property valuation.\nIf you are unable to find your deeds please let me know as soon as possible. \nIf your deeds have been lost it is possible to reconstitute your deeds, but this is a time consuming (and additional cost) process which will delay your Equity\nRelease whilst your property is registered.  Lenders will not proceed until it is proven that you own the property. \nApplication for First Registration take approximately 4 months (from application) to registration.\nWe recognise that the deeds have historic interest to you and we always request their return, but the Land Registry default approach is to destroy the\ndeeds (as they are now defunct for the purposes of proving your ownership) and they are not always returned to us.  When/if the deeds are returned to us\nwe will return them to you.\nMy fees for the additional work are on request.\nSigned Plan\nPlease find enclosed a plan, obtained from the Land Registry, outlining what I believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return\nto me.  If the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent.  It is important that the plan is accurate. If you own any additional land, please\nidentify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct.\nNext Steps\nPlease review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to\nenable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to Equilaw such as account details for existing charges,\ndetails of any occupiers or your management company (if Leasehold) details.  On receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer\nthrough to completion. The offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lender\u2019s solicitors (who will then send it to us).\nWe will issue and send you a \"\nLegal Report Pack\". \nThis pack will come directly from Equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you will\nreceive from JUST directly.\nOffers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. We will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from JUST's solicitors.\n3"}

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\naware of the possible consequences:\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\nseeking.\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\nthe gift.\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from HUB Financial Solutions and it may be that you have\nalready addressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release\nfunds, we recommend that you do so.  \nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable.

Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.

Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible.\n9"}

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\nmade.  Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for\nany errors or delays once the funds leave our account. Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due for\npayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \nShortfalls and Completion Funds\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)\nRegulation and limits on our services\nWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey\nreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the\nsuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance\nplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.  We can perform certain limited services in relation to\ninsurances and investments, provided they are closely linked with the legal services we are providing to you.  \nWe are not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) but we are included\non the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: LS 525526) so that we can carry on insurance mediation activity,\nwhich is broadly advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128503", "filename": "128503/13.pdf", "page_num": 14, "text": "FAQ\n1. \nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\n10. \nWhen will you be in touch with me? \nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.\n14"}

These fraudsters have realised\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\ninterception. \nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\nWhat should you be looking out for?\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\nHow can you protect yourself?\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!\n20"}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\n \nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\nIndemnity Insurance\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\nmade.  Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the payment and we can accept no responsibility for\nany errors or delays once the funds leave our account. Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due for\npayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \nShortfalls and Completion Funds\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)\nRegulation and limits on our services\nWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey\nreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the\nsuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance\nplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.  We can perform certain limited services in relation to\ninsurances and investments, provided they are closely linked with the legal services we are providing to you.  \nWe are not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) but we are included\non the register maintained by them as an exempt professional firm (number: LS 525526) so that we can carry on insurance mediation activity,\nwhich is broadly advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128503", "filename": "128503/18.pdf", "page_num": 6, "text": "FAQ\n1. \nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\n10. \nWhen will you be in touch with me? \nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next."}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\r\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \r\nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\r\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\r\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\r\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\r\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\r\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\r\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\r\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \r\nYour Responsibilities\r\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\r\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\r\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\r\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \r\nOur Charges\r\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\r\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\r\non your behalf (disbursements).  \r\nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\r\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\r\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\r\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\r\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\r\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\r\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\r\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\r\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\r\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\r\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\r\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\r\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\r\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\r\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\r\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\r\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\r\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\r\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\r\n \r\nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\r\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\r\nIndemnity Insurance\r\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\r\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\r\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\r\nthe additional fees schedule.\r\nShortfall\r\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\r\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\r\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\r\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\r\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\r\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\r\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\r\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible."}

You are required to \r\nexplain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.  The provider \r\nwill not complete the transaction until they have received a Certificate which has been signed and completed by \r\nboth you and your client(s), whereby you confirm that you have drawn your client\u2019s(s\u2019) attention to the risks of \r\nentering into an equity release transaction and your client(s) confirms that he/they has/have been given the advice \r\nset out in the Certificate.\r\nGuidance on Independence \r\nClients must use a legal adviser who is independent of the provider\u2019s solicitor.  If you are advising a client in relation \r\nto an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent \r\nof the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013\r\n \r\n\u00b7 the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or \r\nWales); or\r\n\u00b7 the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\r\n\u00b7 the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of \r\nScotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which \r\ntake place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s \r\nRules & Guidance\r\nPayment of Fees \r\nWhilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to \r\nthis guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients \r\nto you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to \r\nyou.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not \r\nbe calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.\r\nThis also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected \r\nwith the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative \r\nor marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel \r\nmembership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of \r\nstaff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision \r\nor purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).

The unused cash facility will therefore be \r\nthe balance of the maximum loan amount permitted by customer age less \r\nthe initial advance.\r\nThe cash facility is guaranteed to be available for the life of the mortgage, \r\nunless one of the following occurs: \r\n \u2022If the total of all the advances exceeds the maximum loan amount based \r\non the borrowers age and property value at the time the request for an \r\nadditional advance is made.\r\n \u2022If we, or another provider (if we have transferred the lifetime mortgage \r\nto them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer \r\noffers lifetime mortgages.\r\n \u2022If the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time \r\nthe request for an additional advance is made.\r\n \u2022If the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, \r\nthere is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either \r\nparty has died.\r\n \u2022If a default event occurs.\r\n \u2022If, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised \r\nby the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our \r\nbusiness) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to \r\nour costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages \r\nor the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical \r\nfor us to provide the additional advance.\r\n \u2022If a second charge has been registered on the property.We sometimes accept applications on \r\nbehalf of individuals by attorneys. But \r\nthere must be a suitable enduring or \r\nlasting power of attorney registered  \r\nwith the relevant authority in the \r\ncountry of residence.\r\nCall 0345 302 2287  or visit justadviser.com"}

We do not \r\ncharge any administration fee for a release from the existing cash facility. \r\nMonthly payment option \r\nCustomers can choose to pay some or all of the monthly interest amount by \r\nDirect Debit. The minimum they can pay is \u00a325, up to 100% of the monthly \r\ninterest amount. A reduction to the roll-up interest rate may apply for \r\ncustomers who decide to pay some or all of the monthly interest amount, \r\nthis will be detailed in the customers offer documentation.\r\nIf they need to take a temporary break from the monthly payments, \r\nproviding they give us 1 months notice, they can take a payment holiday of \r\nup to 3 consecutive months in any 12 month period following the completion \r\nof the loan.

Any \r\nreplacement offer will be in line with the terms available at the time, so the \r\ninterest rate may change. Interest is charged on a monthly basis and added \r\nto the outstanding balance each month on the payment due date. Interest \r\nis charged from the date the advance is released to the borrower\u2019s legal \r\nadviser, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full, or in the event of \r\nearly repayment until the latter of either the date the amount owed is repaid \r\nin full or if repaid before the end of the 14 day notice period until the end of \r\nthat notice period.\r\nFor additional advances the interest rate will be set at the time it\u2019s requested. \r\nCustomers will be informed of the rate in writing. Once again, this interest rate \r\nwill be guaranteed for six weeks from the date the confirmation is issued. \r\nIf the additional advance is not drawn within six weeks of the confirmation, \r\nthe offer will expire. Any replacement offer will be in line with the terms \r\navailable at the time, so once again the interest rate may change. \r\nPlease note, in section 8 of the Key Facts Illustration (KFI) we take into account \r\ncalendar years rather than compounding years. Therefore if the customer is \r\nservicing 100% of the monthly interest amount, the balance in the table in \r\nsection 8 may include some interest. For example, if a customer completes \r\ntheir initial advance on 2 January 2021 and has chosen to service 100% \r\nof their monthly interest amount with a payment date of the 15th of each \r\nmonth, section 8 of the KFI would show in year 1 the balance at the end of  \r\n2 January 2022. By this date interest has accumulated from 15 December \r\n2021 (the last payment) to 2 January 2022. However the customer hasn\u2019t had \r\na chance to pay that off as their direct debit date isn\u2019t until 15 January 2022. \r\nTherefore the interest that has been accumulated is included in the balance  \r\nin section 8.\r\nFees, remuneration and charges \r\nTo find out more about fees, remuneration and charges, see our \u2018Just For You \r\nLifetime Mortgage \u2013 at a glance\u2019 guide.

It\u2019s designed to be repaid only \r\nwhen your customer (or both customers, in the case of borrowing jointly) has \r\ndied or permanently moved into long-term care.\r\nThe mortgage must be repaid within 12 months from when your customer \r\n(or both customers in the case of borrowing jointly) has died or permanently \r\nmoved into long-term care. For example, your customer might move into a \r\ncare home or live with and be cared for by relatives on a permanent basis \r\ndue to medical necessity. \r\nIf the mortgage isn\u2019t repaid within 12 months, we may appoint  \r\na representative to market and sell the property. \r\nIf the mortgage is repaid at any time before the death or entry into \r\npermanent long-term care of all applicants, then the customer(s)  \r\nmay have to pay an early repayment charge. \r\nThe mortgage may also have to be repaid if the property is left vacant  \r\nfor more than three months. \r\nUsually the mortgage will be repaid from the sale proceeds of the property, \r\nbut it can be repaid from other funds if needed. \r\nVoluntary early repayment \r\nIf your customer(s) repay their lifetime mortgage early, there may be an \r\nearly repayment charge to pay. This is to protect us against the financial \r\nconsequences of their decision not to keep the mortgage for the full term. \r\nWe do not charge an exit administration fee for early repayment. \r\nThe Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if the \r\nlifetime mortgage is repaid early.   \r\nWe offer two different Early Repayment Charge options: Variable and Fixed.  \r\nThe type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset. Once the \r\nInitial Advance has completed, the type of Early Repayment Charge cannot \r\nbe changed and will be applicable to the Initial Advance and all subsequent \r\nAdvances.

For \r\neach advance, they can pay back up to 10% of the advance amount in each \r\n12-month period following completion, in up to six instalments providing they \r\nare not servicing any of the monthly interest amount. The minimum overall \r\namount they can pay in each instalment is \u00a3500, and the remaining amount \r\nowed must be at least \u00a310,000. \r\nIf more than one advance has been taken, we will allocate the amount \r\nrepaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. If the amount \r\nrepaid is more than 10% there may be an early repayment charge payable. \r\nAlso, if the customer(s) sell their property and transfers the lifetime \r\nmortgage to a new property that is acceptable to us, we may ask them to \r\nmake a part repayment. This may happen, for example, if the customer(s) \r\nnew property is worth less than their existing one. If this happens, we won\u2019t \r\ncharge an early repayment charge on that part repayment.\r\nNo-negative-equity guarantee \r\nAs long as the customers have complied with the terms and conditions, they \r\nwon\u2019t have to pay more than the sale proceeds of the property, even if it\u2019s \r\nless than the amount owed. There\u2019s no added charge for this guarantee. \r\nValuation report \r\nBefore we make an offer, we need a property valuation which is an \r\nestimation of the worth of the customer\u2019s property carried out by a \r\nprofessional valuer. We choose a surveyor to carry out the valuation. \r\nMoving home \r\nIf your customers want to move home, it may be possible to transfer their \r\nlifetime mortgage to a new property, if the new property is acceptable to us. \r\nOne condition is that the sale of the old property and purchase of the new \r\nproperty take place at the same time. \r\nIf the new property has a higher value than the old property, it may be \r\npossible to apply for a further advance. But this is subject to the lending \r\ncriteria at the time. \r\nIn some instances, for example if the customer is transferring the lifetime \r\nmortgage to a lower value property, we may reduce the cash facility. \r\nWe may ask the customer to repay part of the amount owed in line with \r\nlending criteria applicable at the time. We do not charge an application \r\nfee for transferring the lifetime mortgage. \r\nIf the customer has taken more than one advance, we will allocate the \r\namount repaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. There \r\nwill be no early repayment charge in these circumstances. If customers \r\nchoose to repay more than required, an early repayment charge will apply \r\nonly to the extra amount repaid. \r\nThe new property will need to be valued by a surveyor. We\u2019ll choose a \r\nsurveyor to do the valuation. The valuation fee will be the fee applicable  \r\nto a new Just Lifetime Mortgage at the time. \r\nYour customer will be responsible for all the costs of moving.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in \nsome instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without \nfurther approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.\nYou do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your \nlifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as \ndescribed in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly \n(or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that \ninterest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is \nusually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently \nleave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before \nthis time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.\n1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement\n1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these \nLifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, \nMortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime \nMortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of \nthese documents.\n1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the \ndocuments apply in the following order of priority:\na) your Offer Pack;\nb) Tariff of Charges;\nc) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; and\nd)  Mortgage Deed.\n2. Your Cash Facility\n2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The \namount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n3. Your Initial Advance\n3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an \namount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial \nAdvance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to \nyour legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Additional Advances\nYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional \nborrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your \nmost recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. \nIf you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how \nmuch you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is \navailable and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to \nthis Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you \nan Additional Advance Offer.\n4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional \nAdvance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The \namount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for \nat least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your \nInitial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to \nthe value of the Unused Cash Facility. \n4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an \nAdditional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional \nAdvance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the \nInterest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that \nwill apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable \nto the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).\n4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your \nacceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of \nthe Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your \nAdditional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be \nin your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at \nleast one of you. \n4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request \nat any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  \nbank account.\n4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  \nsecured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  \nmortgage Agreement.\n5. Your Unused Cash Facility\n5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any \nAdditional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each \ntime you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the \nAmount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow \nin your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee \nfor your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not \naffect the Unused Cash Facility.\n5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your \nUnused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional \nAdvance Offer.4\n5\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  \nAdditional Advances\nThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an \nAdditional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime \nmortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a \nmaterial way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more \nmoney to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you \nwill be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have \nnot used all of your Cash Facility. \n6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional \nAdvances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the \nfollowing circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will \nnot be available to you:\na) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the \nMaximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nb) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime \nmortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; \nc) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nd) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in \nScotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the \nProperty), and either party has died; \ne) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  \nSection 43); \nf) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer \nauthorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible \nfor regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to \nlend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example \nthe cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding \nour lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to \nprovide the Additional Advance;or\ng) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section \n29.2 for more details of this restriction).\n6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional \nAdvances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and \ndocumentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased \nborrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  \nexpenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  \nto provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does \nnot Complete.\n6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property \nin Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have \nthe right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to \nvalue the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the \nvaluation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms \nthat we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will \nrefund the Valuation Fee to you.6\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Increasing your Cash Facility\nWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to \nus to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and \ncondition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may \nagree to provide additional borrowing.  \nYou can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, \nbut each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this \nsection. You will also require further financial advice from your financial \nadviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.\n7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to \nborrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the \namount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. \nAny increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime \nmortgage Agreement.

The Property as security\nYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount \nOwed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional \nAdvances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will \nincrease the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.\n8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the \nProperty for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until \nyou have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any \nrepayments you make in the meantime.\n8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have \nsigned and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal \ncharge will be registered against the title to the Property at the \nLand Registry.\n8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we \nmay require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an \nappropriate deed for this purpose.\n8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold \nor management company, we may require an assignment of the \nshare or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must \nsign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, \nwe will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.\n8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and \nby carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you \nhave with anyone else.\n9. Interest\nThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime \nmortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over \nthe duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest \nis charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of \ninterest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in \nyour Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest \nrate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime \nmortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the \nstart of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these \nMonthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). \n9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate \nthat is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest \nrate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. \nThe Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or \nlower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  \nan Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  \ntime we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance.  98\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

From time to time, \nwe may review the Fees that we charge and we may add new Fees \nand/or make changes to them for the following reasons, to reflect :\n11.3.1  a change to our reasonable costs of providing the services;  \nor\n11.3.2  any laws or regulations we have to comply with (or to take  \naccount of any decision by a court ombudsman or similar \nbody) or any industry guidance or code of practice we \nfollow. \nAny increase will be a reasonable proportion, based on our \nreasonable estimate, of the impact of the underlying change  \non the costs we incur in our mortgage lending business.\n11.4 If we change the Fees that we charge, we will provide you with a \nnew Tariff of Charges.\n12. Costs that you may need to pay \nDuring your lifetime mortgage you may need to pay charges, fees \nand expenses to others. You may also need to pay Costs to us and \nthis section explains what would happen if you do not pay them. \nThroughout this booklet, we have signposted in each section typical \nCosts that may arise.\n12.1  You must pay your own charges, fees and expenses that are \npayable to others (for example your financial adviser or legal \nadviser) that arise from setting up and implementing your lifetime \nmortgage or in connection with your lifetime mortgage, unless we \nand you have specifically agreed otherwise.12\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

No negative equity guarantee\nYour lifetime mortgage Agreement includes a \u2018no negative equity \nguarantee\u2019. This means that when the Property is sold for a fair \nmarket price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime \nmortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay \nmore than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount \nOwed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section \nexplains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.\n36.1  You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. \nIf we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might \nbe less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment \nCharge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer \nto assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable \nValuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.\n36.2  If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale \nProceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached \nyour lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale \nProceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have \nbreached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms \nof Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no \nnegative equity guarantee.\n36.3  If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale \nProceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to \nconsent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at \nless than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough \nto cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee \nwill not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of \nmoney between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market \nprice as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  \nAmount Owed.\n36.4  In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably \nbelieve that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, \nwe may spend money on the Property in order to make it more \nmarketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the \nProperty. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added \nto the Amount Owed and interest will be charged. We will only \nexercise this right where it is reasonable to do so (for example, \nwhere the house is in a poor state of repair). We will not spend \nmore than an amount that, when we spend it, we reasonably \nexpect to be recovered when the Property is sold. If we are unable \nto sell the Property for fair market value, we reserve the right to \nrent the Property until such time as a value can be achieved. \n36.5  If you have seriously breached your lifetime mortgage Agreement \nand as a result of that breach the value of the Property has been \nreduced, and/or the Amount Owed has increased, and that breach \nresults in or contributes to the Sale Proceeds being less than \nthe Amount Owed, the no negative equity guarantee will not \napply in full. In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall \nbetween the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we \nreasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your \nbreach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

This means if the \nProperty is located in England or Wales, the competent court will \nbe the courts of England and Wales. If the Property is located in \nScotland, the competent court will be the Scottish courts. If the \nProperty is located in Northern Ireland, the competent court will be \nthe courts in Northern Ireland.\n52.5  If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement become invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining \nterms and conditions will not be affected in any way.\n52.6  If any of the terms and conditions of your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement are not consistent with anything in an Offer, the terms \nof the Offer will apply.\n53.

Variations for Properties in Scotland \nDue to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland \nthen this section will apply to you.\n55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If \nthe Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in \njoint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and \nso each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property \nas you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically \ntransferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. \nIn Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants \nin common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred \nto as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership \nrather than tenancy.\n55.2  Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, \nthis means a standard security under the Conveyancing and \nFeudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a \nfirst legal charge, we mean a first standard security.\n55.3  In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are \nreferences to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for \na house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that \nmention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that \nthey do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d \nmeans owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated \nby the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to \nin Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to \npayment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property \nunder a lease.54\n55\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

In Scotland, if the occupier is  \nyour spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, \nhe or she will be required to sign the standard security, with \nthe help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your \ngranting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the \nProperty take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she \nmay otherwise have.\n55.6  Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the \nequivalent is conclusion of missives.\n55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.\n55.8  If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within \nthe meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions \nset out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into \npossession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  \nsell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 \nAct and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the \n1970 Act.\n55.9  There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a \nproperty receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section \n45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.\n55.10  5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do \nall or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can \ndecide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that \nwe incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, \napart from the reference to a receiver.\n55.11  We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. \nFor example, we will have the power to insure the Property.

What is a lifetime mortgage?  \r\n \r\n \r\nImportant information from the Financial Conduct Authority:  \r\n\uf0b7 A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your \r\nlife, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump \r\nsum/or a regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the \r\nproceeds of the sale of your ho me after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this \r\nwould be after the death of the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your \r\nbeneficiaries.  \r\n \r\n\uf0b7 If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home,  \r\nor you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay \r\nthe amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Any \r\nmoney left over belongs to you.  \r\n \r\n\uf0b7 If you move into sheltered accommodation o r long -term care you will usually have to repay the \r\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Again, any \r\nmoney left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you \r\nneeds to move into long -term care, you don't usually have to sell your home until the last \r\nborrower either dies or moves into long -term care or another Property.  \r\n \r\n\uf0b7 If you decide that you simply don't want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the \r\namount you owe to the  lender at any ti me, but the lender may make an E arly Repayment \r\nCharge if you do. Section 13 of this Offer document will tell you if any Early Repayment Charges \r\napply to this mortgage.  \r\n \r\n\uf0b7 Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment - this means you b orrow a lump sum \r\nwhich is invested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the \r\nfull details of the investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read \r\nboth documents together.  \r\n \r\n "}

Description of this mortgage  \r\n \r\nThis Offer Document  is for a  Saga Lifetime Mortgage  provided by Just.  \r\n \r\nInterest Rate  \r\nThe Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate of 6.75%  (a rate that will not \r\nchange for the duration of your lifetime mort gage).  \r\nSee Section 9 for more information regarding the Interest Rates that will apply to Additional \r\nAdvances.  \r\n \r\nThe Interest Rate applicable to the Initial Advance may be offered as a reduction to our current \r\nInterest Rate.

This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls -up\u2019. The amount \r\nof interest charged therefore increases as the in terest \u2018rolls -up\u2019. The amount of interest charged, \r\nand how this increases over time, is illustrated in Section 8.  \r\n \r\nEligibility  \r\nAt the time of application, the Saga Lifetime Mortgage  is only available to borrowers aged 55 and \r\nover.  \r\n \r\nThe minimum Initial Advance is \u00a310,000.00 , subject to your Property being acceptable to us and \r\nmeeting our minimum Property value requirements . \r\n \r\nInitial Advance  \r\nThis lifetime mortgage provides you with an Initial Advance of \u00a395,000.00  at Completion.  \r\n \r\nCash Facility  \r\nYou will be able to borrow up to the amount of your Cash Facility of  \u00a3137,500.00  (including the \r\nInitial Advance), unless certain  exceptional circumstances apply as described in Section 14.  \r\n \r\nWhen you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can \r\nrequest us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we a re not obliged to increase it . See \r\nSection 14, \u2018Additional s ecured borrowing\u2019 for more details.  \r\n \r\nUnused Cash Facility  \r\nThe maximum amount that you may borrow, from your Cash Facility, following your Initial \r\nAdvance, is  \u00a342,500.00 . This will be referred to as your Unused Cash Facility . \r\n \r\nAdditional Advances  \r\nYou can request an Additional Advance at any time while you are still living in the Property, which \r\nmust be for at least the Minimum Additional Advance amount of  \u00a32,000.00 . Additional Advances \r\nare subject to your lifetime mortgage Agreement and will be based on the terms available from \r\nJust at the time, as described in Section 14.  \r\n \r\nIn exceptional circumstances you will be unable to take Additional Advances.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in \nsome instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without \nfurther approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.\nYou do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your \nlifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as \ndescribed in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly \n(or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that \ninterest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is \nusually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently \nleave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before \nthis time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.\n1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement\n1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these \nLifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, \nMortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime \nMortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of \nthese documents.\n1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the \ndocuments apply in the following order of priority:\na) your Offer Pack;\nb) Tariff of Charges;\nc) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; and\nd)  Mortgage Deed.\n2.

You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  \nexpenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  \nto provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does \nnot Complete.\n6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property \nin Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have \nthe right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to \nvalue the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the \nvaluation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms \nthat we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will \nrefund the Valuation Fee to you.6\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

The Property as security\nYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount \nOwed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional \nAdvances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will \nincrease the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.\n8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the \nProperty for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until \nyou have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any \nrepayments you make in the meantime.\n8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have \nsigned and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal \ncharge will be registered against the title to the Property at the \nLand Registry.\n8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we \nmay require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an \nappropriate deed for this purpose.\n8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold \nor management company, we may require an assignment of the \nshare or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must \nsign an appropriate deed for this purpose.

Interest\nThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime \nmortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over \nthe duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest \nis charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of \ninterest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in \nyour Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest \nrate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime \nmortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the \nstart of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these \nMonthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). \n9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate \nthat is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest \nrate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. \nThe Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or \nlower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  \nan Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  \ntime we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance.  98\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Insuring the Property\nYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we \nwant to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a \nmortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.\n25.1  You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage \nwith a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you \nwill not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone \nelse has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if \nthe Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or \nmanagement company to insure it. In that case, you must do all \nyou reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management \ncompany insures it.\n25.2  The insurance policy must:\na) be with a reputable insurer;\nb) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report \nfor the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to \ncover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to \ndemolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the \nProperty, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  \npay for alternative accommodation;\nc) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in \naccordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  \nother index as we reasonably require;\nd) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from \ntime to time reasonably require;\ne) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately \nbefore exchange of contracts, or the date on which the \nAdvance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  \nis the earliest; and\nf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two \nBusiness Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.\n25.3  Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance \npolicy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a \nchange in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as \njoint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) \nor co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the \ninsurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint \ninsured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you \nwith details of the type of policy we require. \n25.4  You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or \nwhich might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or \nreduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example \ngiving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property \nunoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the \ninsurance policy.\n25.5  You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  \nus your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or \nother evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  \nto date.25\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Early Repayment Charges\nIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an \nEarly Repayment Charge.

The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at \noutset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early \nRepayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the \nInitial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your \nOffer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime \nMortgage. \nFurther details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash \nexamples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each \nAdditional Advance Offer.

If we refer to a \nfirst legal charge, we mean a first standard security.\n55.3  In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are \nreferences to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for \na house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that \nmention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that \nthey do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d \nmeans owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated \nby the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to \nin Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to \npayment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property \nunder a lease.54\n55\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

In Scotland, if the occupier is  \nyour spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, \nhe or she will be required to sign the standard security, with \nthe help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your \ngranting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the \nProperty take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she \nmay otherwise have.\n55.6  Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the \nequivalent is conclusion of missives.\n55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.\n55.8  If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within \nthe meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions \nset out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into \npossession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  \nsell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 \nAct and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the \n1970 Act.\n55.9  There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a \nproperty receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section \n45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.\n55.10  5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do \nall or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can \ndecide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that \nwe incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, \napart from the reference to a receiver.\n55.11  We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. \nFor example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We \nmay exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs.

If we have to sell the Property, \nwe may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. \nWe may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. \nYou will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those \nCosts when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and \ninterest will apply to those Costs. If the Property is sold by us, it \ncan be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by \nprivate sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, \nin instalments or a partial payment. If we sell the Property, we \ncan make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or \neven withdraw from any contract for sale.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in \nsome instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without \nfurther approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.\nYou do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your \nlifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as \ndescribed in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly \n(or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that \ninterest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is \nusually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently \nleave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before \nthis time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.\n1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement\n1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these \nLifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, \nMortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime \nMortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of \nthese documents.\n1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the \ndocuments apply in the following order of priority:\na) your Offer Pack;\nb) Tariff of Charges;\nc) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; and\nd)  Mortgage Deed.\n2. Your Cash Facility\n2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The \namount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n3. Your Initial Advance\n3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an \namount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial \nAdvance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to \nyour legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Additional Advances\nYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional \nborrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your \nmost recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. \nIf you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how \nmuch you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is \navailable and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to \nthis Additional Advance.

Additional Advances are only available up to \nthe value of the Unused Cash Facility. \n4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an \nAdditional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional \nAdvance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the \nInterest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that \nwill apply.

Your chosen bank account must be \nin your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at \nleast one of you. \n4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request \nat any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  \nbank account.\n4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  \nsecured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  \nmortgage Agreement.\n5. Your Unused Cash Facility\n5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any \nAdditional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each \ntime you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the \nAmount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow \nin your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee \nfor your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not \naffect the Unused Cash Facility.\n5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your \nUnused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional \nAdvance Offer.4\n5\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

This section sets out specific circumstances when you \nwill be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have \nnot used all of your Cash Facility. \n6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional \nAdvances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the \nfollowing circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will \nnot be available to you:\na) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the \nMaximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nb) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime \nmortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; \nc) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nd) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in \nScotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the \nProperty), and either party has died; \ne) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  \nSection 43); \nf) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer \nauthorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible \nfor regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to \nlend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example \nthe cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding \nour lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to \nprovide the Additional Advance;or\ng) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section \n29.2 for more details of this restriction).\n6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional \nAdvances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and \ndocumentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased \nborrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  \nexpenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  \nto provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does \nnot Complete.\n6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property \nin Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have \nthe right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to \nvalue the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the \nvaluation of the Property. In the event that this valuation confirms \nthat we should have provided the Additional Advance then we will \nrefund the Valuation Fee to you.6\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

The Property as security\nYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount \nOwed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional \nAdvances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will \nincrease the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.\n8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the \nProperty for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until \nyou have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any \nrepayments you make in the meantime.\n8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have \nsigned and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal \ncharge will be registered against the title to the Property at the \nLand Registry.\n8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we \nmay require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an \nappropriate deed for this purpose.\n8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold \nor management company, we may require an assignment of the \nshare or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must \nsign an appropriate deed for this purpose.

Interest\nThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime \nmortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over \nthe duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest \nis charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of \ninterest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in \nyour Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest \nrate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime \nmortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the \nstart of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these \nMonthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). \n9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate \nthat is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest \nrate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. \nThe Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or \nlower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  \nan Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  \ntime we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance.  98\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Insuring the Property\nYou will continue to be responsible for insuring the Property, but we \nwant to make sure that the cover is sufficient and our interest as a \nmortgage lender is protected should an insurance claim be necessary.\n25.1  You must keep the Property fully insured against loss or damage \nwith a reputable insurance company we approve of. Sometimes you \nwill not be able to insure the Property yourself because someone \nelse has the legal right to insure it. An example of that would be if \nthe Property is leasehold and the lease requires your freeholder or \nmanagement company to insure it. In that case, you must do all \nyou reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management \ncompany insures it.\n25.2  The insurance policy must:\na) be with a reputable insurer;\nb) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report \nfor the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to \ncover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to \ndemolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the \nProperty, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  \npay for alternative accommodation;\nc) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in \naccordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  \nother index as we reasonably require;\nd) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from \ntime to time reasonably require;\ne) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately \nbefore exchange of contracts, or the date on which the \nAdvance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  \nis the earliest; and\nf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two \nBusiness Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.\n25.3  Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance \npolicy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a \nchange in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as \njoint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) \nor co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the \ninsurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint \ninsured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you \nwith details of the type of policy we require. \n25.4  You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or \nwhich might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or \nreduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example \ngiving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property \nunoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the \ninsurance policy.\n25.5  You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  \nus your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or \nother evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  \nto date.25\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Early Repayment Charges\nIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an \nEarly Repayment Charge.

The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at \noutset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early \nRepayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the \nInitial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your \nOffer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime \nMortgage. \nFurther details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash \nexamples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each \nAdditional Advance Offer.

If we refer to a \nfirst legal charge, we mean a first standard security.\n55.3  In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are \nreferences to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for \na house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that \nmention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that \nthey do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d \nmeans owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated \nby the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to \nin Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to \npayment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property \nunder a lease.54\n55\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

In Scotland, if the occupier is  \nyour spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, \nhe or she will be required to sign the standard security, with \nthe help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your \ngranting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the \nProperty take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she \nmay otherwise have.\n55.6  Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the \nequivalent is conclusion of missives.\n55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.\n55.8  If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within \nthe meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions \nset out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into \npossession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  \nsell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 \nAct and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the \n1970 Act.\n55.9  There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a \nproperty receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section \n45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.\n55.10  5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do \nall or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can \ndecide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that \nwe incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, \napart from the reference to a receiver.\n55.11  We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. \nFor example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We \nmay exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we \ntake some action in relation to the Property but have not taken \npossession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. \nThis means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for \nexample, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, \nwe may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. \nWe may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. \nYou will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those \nCosts when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and \ninterest will apply to those Costs. If the Property is sold by us, it \ncan be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by \nprivate sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, \nin instalments or a partial payment. If we sell the Property, we \ncan make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or \neven withdraw from any contract for sale.

You are required to \r\nexplain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.  The provider \r\nwill not complete the transaction until they have received a Certificate which has been signed and completed by \r\nboth you and your client(s), whereby you confirm that you have drawn your client\u2019s(s\u2019) attention to the risks of \r\nentering into an equity release transaction and your client(s) confirms that he/they has/have been given the advice \r\nset out in the Certificate.\r\nGuidance on Independence \r\nClients must use a legal adviser who is independent of the provider\u2019s solicitor.  If you are advising a client in relation \r\nto an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent \r\nof the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013\r\n \r\n\u00b7 the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or \r\nWales); or\r\n\u00b7 the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\r\n\u00b7 the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of \r\nScotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which \r\ntake place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s \r\nRules & Guidance\r\nPayment of Fees \r\nWhilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to \r\nthis guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients \r\nto you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to \r\nyou.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not \r\nbe calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.\r\nThis also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected \r\nwith the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative \r\nor marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel \r\nmembership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of \r\nstaff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision \r\nor purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).  For the avoidance of doubt, certain \r\nmarketing payments which are not connected with payment on a case-by-case basis are permitted, subject to the \r\nregulatory obligations of the parties concerned. You must inform your client(s) in writing of the amount and \r\nfrequency of any financial arrangement, including marketing contributions, when issuing the customer case \r\ndocumentation at the outset.\r\nIf the customer chooses not to instruct their own legal adviser, the adviser or provider (as appropriate) may offer \r\nthe name of at least one local law firm which has knowledge of equity release products.  The adviser or provider \r\nmust ensure that no pressure or financial inducement is involved in directing customers to any particular law firm \r\neither by them or the intermediaries recommending their products.\r\nReceipt of Payments \r\nIf you are acting on behalf of the client you may not receive payments or other consideration from the adviser or \r\nprovider if that payment is dependent on the completion of an equity release transaction.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in \nsome instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without \nfurther approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.\nYou do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your \nlifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as \ndescribed in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly \n(or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that \ninterest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is \nusually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently \nleave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before \nthis time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.\n1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement\n1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these \nLifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, \nMortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime \nMortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of \nthese documents.\n1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the \ndocuments apply in the following order of priority:\na) your Offer Pack;\nb) Tariff of Charges;\nc) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; and\nd)  Mortgage Deed.\n2. Your Cash Facility\n2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The \namount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n3. Your Initial Advance\n3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an \namount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial \nAdvance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to \nyour legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Additional Advances\nYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional \nborrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your \nmost recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. \nIf you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how \nmuch you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is \navailable and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to \nthis Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you \nan Additional Advance Offer.\n4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional \nAdvance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The \namount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for \nat least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your \nInitial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to \nthe value of the Unused Cash Facility. \n4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an \nAdditional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional \nAdvance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the \nInterest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that \nwill apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable \nto the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).\n4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your \nacceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of \nthe Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your \nAdditional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be \nin your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at \nleast one of you. \n4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request \nat any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  \nbank account.\n4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  \nsecured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  \nmortgage Agreement.\n5. Your Unused Cash Facility\n5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any \nAdditional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each \ntime you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the \nAmount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow \nin your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee \nfor your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not \naffect the Unused Cash Facility.\n5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your \nUnused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional \nAdvance Offer.4\n5\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  \nAdditional Advances\nThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an \nAdditional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime \nmortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a \nmaterial way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more \nmoney to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you \nwill be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have \nnot used all of your Cash Facility. \n6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional \nAdvances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the \nfollowing circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will \nnot be available to you:\na) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the \nMaximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nb) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime \nmortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; \nc) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nd) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in \nScotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the \nProperty), and either party has died; \ne) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  \nSection 43); \nf) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer \nauthorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible \nfor regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to \nlend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example \nthe cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding \nour lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to \nprovide the Additional Advance;or\ng) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section \n29.2 for more details of this restriction).\n6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional \nAdvances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and \ndocumentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased \nborrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  \nexpenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  \nto provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does \nnot Complete.\n6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property \nin Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have \nthe right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to \nvalue the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the \nvaluation of the Property.

Increasing your Cash Facility\nWhen you have used up your Cash Facility, you may choose to apply to \nus to increase it. Depending upon your circumstances, the value and \ncondition of the Property and our lending criteria at the time, we may \nagree to provide additional borrowing.  \nYou can apply to increase your Cash Facility as many times as you wish, \nbut each time you do so you need to pay Fees as referred to in this \nsection. You will also require further financial advice from your financial \nadviser and, if we ask, legal advice from an independent legal adviser.\n7.1 When you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to \nborrow more than is available, you can request us to increase the \namount of your Cash Facility, but we are not obliged to increase it. \nAny increase to your Cash Facility will be subject to your lifetime \nmortgage Agreement.

The Property as security\nYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount \nOwed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional \nAdvances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will \nincrease the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.\n8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the \nProperty for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until \nyou have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any \nrepayments you make in the meantime.\n8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have \nsigned and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal \ncharge will be registered against the title to the Property at the \nLand Registry.\n8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we \nmay require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an \nappropriate deed for this purpose.\n8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold \nor management company, we may require an assignment of the \nshare or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must \nsign an appropriate deed for this purpose. If we sell the Property, \nwe will transfer the share or shares to the purchaser.\n8.5 You must ensure that by taking out your lifetime mortgage and \nby carrying out your obligations under your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement you are not breaking any lease or any agreements you \nhave with anyone else.\n9. Interest\nThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime \nmortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over \nthe duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest \nis charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of \ninterest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in \nyour Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest \nrate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime \nmortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the \nstart of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these \nMonthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). \n9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate \nthat is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest \nrate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. \nThe Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or \nlower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  \nan Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  \ntime we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance.  98\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

The Interest Rate charged will \nsubsequently increase to the rate shown in your Offer and your \nlifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of interest basis \nfor the remaining term.\n10.8  You may request one Payment Holiday of up to 3 consecutive \nmonths in each 12 month period following Completion of the Initial \nAdvance, providing you give us 1 month\u2019s written notice. Interest \nnot paid during a Payment Holiday will be added to the Amount \nOwed and interest will \u2018roll up\u2019 on this for the remaining term of \nyour lifetime mortgage.\n10.9  If you fail to make the agreed Monthly Payment for any month \nwithin 3 working days of the next Monthly Payment due date \nthen the payment will be classed as missed. If you fail to make \nthe agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of \nyour lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments \nand you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest \nRate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your \nOffer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of \ninterest basis for the remaining term. 10\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

This means that when the Property is sold for a fair \nmarket price and as long as you are not in breach of your lifetime \nmortgage Agreement, you or your beneficiaries will not have to pay \nmore than the Sale Proceeds, even if these are less than the Amount \nOwed. There is no additional charge for this guarantee. This section \nexplains how this guarantee works and when it will apply.\n36.1  You must seek our written permission before you sell the Property. \nIf we reasonably believe that the anticipated Sale Proceeds might \nbe less than the Amount Owed, including any Early Repayment \nCharge payable, we may instruct an independent, qualified Valuer \nto assess the Property value.  You will need to pay a non-refundable \nValuation Fee before the valuation is carried out.\n36.2  If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale \nProceeds reflect a fair market price and you have not breached \nyour lifetime mortgage Agreement, we will accept the Sale \nProceeds as full repayment of the Amount Owed. If you have \nbreached your lifetime mortgage Agreement, then the terms \nof Section 36.5 will apply and you may not benefit from the no \nnegative equity guarantee.\n36.3  If the independent valuation confirms that the anticipated Sale \nProceeds do not reflect a fair market price, we do not have to \nconsent to the sale of the Property. If we do consent to the sale at \nless than a fair market price, and the Sale Proceeds are not enough \nto cover the Amount Owed then the no negative equity guarantee \nwill not apply in full, and you will have to pay us any shortfall of \nmoney between the Sale Proceeds and the lower of the fair market \nprice as confirmed by the independent valuation and the  \nAmount Owed.\n36.4  In the case of any proposed sale of the Property, if we reasonably \nbelieve that the Sale Proceeds will be less than the Amount Owed, \nwe may spend money on the Property in order to make it more \nmarketable. This may include paying for further valuations of the \nProperty. Any amount we spend under this Section will be added \nto the Amount Owed and interest will be charged.

In this instance you will have to pay us the shortfall \nbetween the Sale Proceeds and the Amount Owed to the extent we \nreasonably consider that the shortfall has arisen because of your \nbreach of the lifetime mortgage Agreement.36\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

We will take \ninto account the nature of the breach, how long it will reasonably \ntake you to remedy the breach and any risk of damage to the \nProperty or harm to our interest as the mortgage lender.\n42.3  If you do not remedy the breach, and the breach is serious, then \nwe reserve the right, but are not obliged, to take action to protect \nour rights and the value of the Property and the security for your \nlifetime mortgage. For example, this may require us to enter the \nProperty and carry out repairs.\n42.4  If we take action because of the breach, you will need to pay any \nCosts that we incur. If you fail to pay those Costs when we ask,  \nwe will add them to the Amount Owed, and interest will apply  \nto those Costs.\n42.5  Where we have to take action or incur Costs because you have not \ncomplied with your lifetime mortgage Agreement and so you are \nin breach, our action or incurring of Costs does not stop you being \nin breach of your lifetime mortgage Agreement (whether or not we \nadd Costs to the Amount Owed because you have not paid them).\n42.6  If you breach your lifetime mortgage Agreement, this can affect \nthe no negative equity guarantee.

Variations for Properties in Scotland \nDue to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland \nthen this section will apply to you.\n55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If \nthe Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in \njoint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and \nso each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property \nas you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically \ntransferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. \nIn Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants \nin common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred \nto as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership \nrather than tenancy.\n55.2  Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, \nthis means a standard security under the Conveyancing and \nFeudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a \nfirst legal charge, we mean a first standard security.\n55.3  In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are \nreferences to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for \na house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that \nmention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that \nthey do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d \nmeans owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated \nby the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to \nin Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to \npayment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property \nunder a lease.54\n55\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

In Scotland, if the occupier is  \nyour spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, \nhe or she will be required to sign the standard security, with \nthe help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your \ngranting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the \nProperty take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she \nmay otherwise have.\n55.6  Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the \nequivalent is conclusion of missives.\n55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.\n55.8  If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within \nthe meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions \nset out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into \npossession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  \nsell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 \nAct and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the \n1970 Act.\n55.9  There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a \nproperty receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section \n45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.\n55.10  5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do \nall or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can \ndecide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that \nwe incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, \napart from the reference to a receiver.\n55.11  We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. \nFor example, we will have the power to insure the Property.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in \nsome instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without \nfurther approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.\nYou do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your \nlifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as \ndescribed in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly \n(or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that \ninterest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is \nusually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently \nleave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before \nthis time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.\n1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement\n1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these \nLifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, \nMortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime \nMortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of \nthese documents.\n1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the \ndocuments apply in the following order of priority:\na) your Offer Pack;\nb) Tariff of Charges;\nc) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; and\nd)  Mortgage Deed.\n2. Your Cash Facility\n2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The \namount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n3. Your Initial Advance\n3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an \namount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial \nAdvance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to \nyour legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Additional Advances\nYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional \nborrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your \nmost recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. \nIf you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how \nmuch you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is \navailable and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to \nthis Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you \nan Additional Advance Offer.\n4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional \nAdvance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The \namount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for \nat least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your \nInitial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to \nthe value of the Unused Cash Facility. \n4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an \nAdditional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional \nAdvance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the \nInterest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that \nwill apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable \nto the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).\n4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your \nacceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of \nthe Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your \nAdditional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be \nin your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at \nleast one of you. \n4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request \nat any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  \nbank account.\n4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  \nsecured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  \nmortgage Agreement.\n5. Your Unused Cash Facility\n5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any \nAdditional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each \ntime you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the \nAmount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow \nin your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee \nfor your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not \naffect the Unused Cash Facility.\n5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your \nUnused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional \nAdvance Offer.4\n5\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  \nAdditional Advances\nThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an \nAdditional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime \nmortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a \nmaterial way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more \nmoney to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you \nwill be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have \nnot used all of your Cash Facility. \n6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional \nAdvances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the \nfollowing circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will \nnot be available to you:\na) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the \nMaximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nb) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime \nmortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; \nc) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nd) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in \nScotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the \nProperty), and either party has died; \ne) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  \nSection 43); \nf) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer \nauthorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible \nfor regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to \nlend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example \nthe cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding \nour lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to \nprovide the Additional Advance;or\ng) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section \n29.2 for more details of this restriction).\n6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional \nAdvances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and \ndocumentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased \nborrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  \nexpenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  \nto provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does \nnot Complete.\n6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property \nin Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have \nthe right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to \nvalue the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the \nvaluation of the Property.

The Property as security\nYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount \nOwed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property.

When you have \nsigned and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal \ncharge will be registered against the title to the Property at the \nLand Registry.\n8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we \nmay require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an \nappropriate deed for this purpose.\n8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold \nor management company, we may require an assignment of the \nshare or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must \nsign an appropriate deed for this purpose.

The amount of \ninterest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in \nyour Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest \nrate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime \nmortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the \nstart of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these \nMonthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). \n9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate \nthat is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest \nrate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. \nThe Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or \nlower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance.

The amount of \nyour ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% \nof the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to \ncompletion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  \nOnce your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, \nhowever you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop \nmaking your Monthly Payments altogether.  \nIf you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the \nMonthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime \nof your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-\nup\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making \nMonthly Payments they cannot be restarted. \nThis Section explains more about your options.\n10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance \nyou can select to make Monthly Payments.\n10.2  For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum \nof \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.\n10.3  For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum \nof 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly \nPayments on your Initial Advance.\n10.4  The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the \nAdvance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.\n10.5  Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your \ndesignated bank account on the agreed collection date of either \nthe 1st or 15th of each month.\n10.6  Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your \nMonthly Payments. \n10.7  You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to \ngiving us 1 month\u2019s written notice.

If you fail to make \nthe agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of \nyour lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments \nand you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest \nRate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your \nOffer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of \ninterest basis for the remaining term. 10\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Variations for Properties in Scotland \nDue to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland \nthen this section will apply to you.\n55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If \nthe Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in \njoint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and \nso each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property \nas you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically \ntransferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. \nIn Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants \nin common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred \nto as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership \nrather than tenancy.\n55.2  Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, \nthis means a standard security under the Conveyancing and \nFeudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a \nfirst legal charge, we mean a first standard security.\n55.3  In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are \nreferences to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for \na house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that \nmention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that \nthey do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d \nmeans owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated \nby the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to \nin Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to \npayment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property \nunder a lease.54\n55\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

In Scotland, if the occupier is  \nyour spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, \nhe or she will be required to sign the standard security, with \nthe help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your \ngranting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the \nProperty take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she \nmay otherwise have.\n55.6  Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts.

It will provide you with a Cash Facility and in \nsome instances you may take Additional Advances at any time without \nfurther approval, subject to certain conditions described later in this booklet.\nYou do not need to make any monthly repayments for the duration of your \nlifetime mortgage, unless you have agreed to make Monthly Payments as \ndescribed in Section 10. Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly \n(or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that \ninterest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is \nusually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently \nleave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before \nthis time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.\n1. Your lifetime mortgage Agreement\n1.1 Your lifetime mortgage Agreement with us is made up of these \nLifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions, your Offer Pack, \nMortgage Deed and Tariff of Charges. Where in these Lifetime \nMortgage Terms and Conditions we refer to your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement, we are referring to the terms and conditions in all of \nthese documents.\n1.2 If there is any inconsistency between these documents, the \ndocuments apply in the following order of priority:\na) your Offer Pack;\nb) Tariff of Charges;\nc) these Lifetime Mortgage Terms and Conditions; and\nd)  Mortgage Deed.\n2. Your Cash Facility\n2.1 We have agreed to make available to you a Cash Facility. The \namount of your Cash Facility is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n3. Your Initial Advance\n3.1 You must take an Initial Advance from your Cash Facility for an \namount agreed between us and you. The amount of the Initial \nAdvance is shown in your Initial Advance Offer and will be paid to \nyour legal adviser when your lifetime mortgage Completes.11\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Additional Advances\nYour lifetime mortgage may provide you with access to additional \nborrowing from your Cash Facility without further approval. Your \nmost recent Offer will confirm how much may be available to you. \nIf you wish to take an Additional Advance you should tell us how \nmuch you wish to take and we will then tell you if this amount is \navailable and the Interest Rate and other terms that will apply to \nthis Additional Advance. If you wish to proceed we will send to you \nan Additional Advance Offer.\n4.1 If you have an Unused Cash Facility, you can request an Additional \nAdvance at any time while you are still living in the Property. The \namount of any Additional Advance which is requested must be for \nat least the minimum Additional Advance amount shown in your \nInitial Advance Offer. Additional Advances are only available up to \nthe value of the Unused Cash Facility. \n4.2 If the Additional Advance is available to you, we will send to you an \nAdditional Advance Offer which shows the terms for the Additional \nAdvance including the amount of the Additional Advance, the \nInterest Rate and a description of any Early Repayment Charge that \nwill apply. The Interest Rate may be different to the rate applicable \nto the Initial Advance and any other Additional Advance(s).\n4.3 If you accept the Additional Advance Offer and we receive your \nacceptance before the Offer expires, we will pay the amount of \nthe Additional Advance to your chosen bank account when your \nAdditional Advance Completes.  Your chosen bank account must be \nin your name, or in the case of joint borrowers, in the name of at \nleast one of you. \n4.4 If you request an Additional Advance you may cancel your request \nat any time before we transfer the Additional Advance to your  \nbank account.\n4.5 Additional Advances will increase the amount of borrowing  \nsecured on the Property and are subject to your lifetime  \nmortgage Agreement.\n5. Your Unused Cash Facility\n5.1 The amount of money left in the Cash Facility for you to take any \nAdditional Advances from is called the Unused Cash Facility.  Each \ntime you take an Advance or any Fees or Costs are added to the \nAmount Owed, the amount of money available for you to borrow \nin your Unused Cash Facility will decrease. If the Arrangement Fee \nfor your Initial Advance is added to the Amount Owed, that will not \naffect the Unused Cash Facility.\n5.2 If you take Additional Advances, the amount of money left in your \nUnused Cash Facility will be shown in your most recent Additional \nAdvance Offer.4\n5\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Circumstances when you may be unable to take  \nAdditional Advances\nThere are some circumstances when we may not give you an \nAdditional Advance. This may happen if you breach your lifetime \nmortgage Agreement or if the economic conditions change in a \nmaterial way which has a negative impact on our ability to lend more \nmoney to you. This section sets out specific circumstances when you \nwill be unable to take an Additional Advance even though you have \nnot used all of your Cash Facility. \n6.1 In some circumstances you will be unable to take Additional \nAdvances. If, when you request an Additional Advance any of the \nfollowing circumstances apply, then your Unused Cash Facility will \nnot be available to you:\na) if the total of all the Advances you have received exceeds the \nMaximum Loan Amount based on your age and Property value \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nb) if we, or another provider (if we have transferred your lifetime \nmortgage to them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage \nAgreement) no longer offers lifetime mortgages; \nc) if the Amount Owed exceeds 100% of the value of the Property \nat the time the request for an Additional Advance is made; \nd) if the Property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in \nScotland, there is no survivorship destination in the title to the \nProperty), and either party has died; \ne) if a Default Event occurs (Default Events are set out in  \nSection 43); \nf) if, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer \nauthorised by the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible \nfor regulating our business) has placed limits on our ability to \nlend or there are changes to our costs of funding (for example \nthe cost in administering our mortgages or the cost of funding \nour lending) which results in it being uneconomical for us to \nprovide the Additional Advance;or\ng) if a charge has been registered on the Property (see Section \n29.2 for more details of this restriction).\n6.2 If the event in Section 6.1(d) happens, we may allow Additional \nAdvances if we are satisfied with any arrangements and \ndocumentation agreed with the beneficiaries of the deceased \nborrower. You will be responsible for paying all of the legal  \nexpenses and costs, including our Costs, even if we do not agree  \nto provide the Additional Advance, or the Additional Advance does \nnot Complete.\n6.3 If you believe that our assessment of the value of the Property \nin Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(c) is unreasonable then you have \nthe right to ask us to instruct an independent, qualified Valuer to \nvalue the Property. You will need to pay a Valuation Fee before the \nvaluation of the Property.

The Property as security\nYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount \nOwed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional \nAdvances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will \nincrease the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.\n8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the \nProperty for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until \nyou have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any \nrepayments you make in the meantime.\n8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have \nsigned and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal \ncharge will be registered against the title to the Property at the \nLand Registry.\n8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we \nmay require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an \nappropriate deed for this purpose.\n8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold \nor management company, we may require an assignment of the \nshare or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must \nsign an appropriate deed for this purpose.

Interest\nThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime \nmortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over \nthe duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest \nis charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of \ninterest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in \nyour Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest \nrate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime \nmortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the \nstart of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these \nMonthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). \n9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate \nthat is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest \nrate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. \nThe Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or \nlower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance.

The amount of \nyour ongoing Monthly Payment can be set between \u00a325 to 100% \nof the monthly interest amount and must be confirmed prior to \ncompletion of your Initial Advance and any Additional Advances.  \nOnce your Monthly Payment has been agreed it cannot be amended, \nhowever you will have the ability to take a Payment Holiday or stop \nmaking your Monthly Payments altogether.  \nIf you choose to stop making Monthly Payments, or fail to make the \nMonthly Payments in full on a total of 6 occasions during the lifetime \nof your mortgage, your account will switch to a full interest \u2018roll-\nup\u2019 for the remainder of your loan. Once you have stopped making \nMonthly Payments they cannot be restarted. \nThis Section explains more about your options.\n10.1 At the outset of your Initial Advance and each Additional Advance \nyou can select to make Monthly Payments.\n10.2  For the Initial Advance you can choose to pay between  a minimum \nof \u00a325.00 and a maximum of 100% of the monthly interest.\n10.3  For Additional Advances you can choose to pay up to a maximum \nof 100% of the monthly interest providing you are making Monthly \nPayments on your Initial Advance.\n10.4  The total monthly interest amount is calculated by multiplying the \nAdvance by the Interest Rate and dividing by 12.\n10.5  Your Monthly Payment will be collected by direct debit from your \ndesignated bank account on the agreed collection date of either \nthe 1st or 15th of each month.\n10.6  Once you have Completed you cannot change the amount of your \nMonthly Payments. \n10.7  You can stop making Monthly Payments at any time subject to \ngiving us 1 month\u2019s written notice.

If you fail to make \nthe agreed Monthly Payment on 6 occasions over the duration of \nyour lifetime mortgage, we will stop collecting Monthly Payments \nand you will not be able to re-start them. This means the Interest \nRate charged will subsequently increase to the rate shown in your \nOffer and your lifetime mortgage will then switch to a full roll up of \ninterest basis for the remaining term. 10\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Variations for Properties in Scotland \nDue to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland \nthen this section will apply to you.\n55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If \nthe Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in \njoint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and \nso each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property \nas you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically \ntransferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. \nIn Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants \nin common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred \nto as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership \nrather than tenancy.\n55.2  Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, \nthis means a standard security under the Conveyancing and \nFeudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a \nfirst legal charge, we mean a first standard security.\n55.3  In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are \nreferences to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for \na house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that \nmention leaseholds will apply to you. In the unlikely event that \nthey do, \u201cleasehold\u201d means held on a long lease and \u201cfreehold\u201d \nmeans owned. Forfeiture means that the lease is terminated \nby the landlord because of a breach and this is referred to \nin Scotland as irritancy. In section 24, there is reference to \npayment of rent which would only apply if you held the Property \nunder a lease.54\n55\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

In Scotland, if the occupier is  \nyour spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, \nhe or she will be required to sign the standard security, with \nthe help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your \ngranting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the \nProperty take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she \nmay otherwise have.\n55.6  Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts.

What is a lifetime mortgage?  \n \n \nImportant information from the Financial Conduct Authority:  \n\uf0b7 A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your \nlife, and which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump \nsum/or a regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the \nproceeds of the sale of your ho me after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this \nwould be after the death of the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your \nbeneficiaries.  \n \n\uf0b7 If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home,  \nor you may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay \nthe amount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home.

Description of this mortgage  \n \nThis Offer Document  is for a  Saga Lifetime Mortgage  provided by Just.  \n \nInterest Rate  \nThe Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate of 6.75%  (a rate that will not \nchange for the duration of your lifetime mort gage).  \nSee Section 9 for more information regarding the Interest Rates that will apply to Additional \nAdvances.  \n \nThe Interest Rate applicable to the Initial Advance may be offered as a reduction to our current \nInterest Rate.

This means that interest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls -up\u2019. The amount \nof interest charged therefore increases as the in terest \u2018rolls -up\u2019. The amount of interest charged, \nand how this increases over time, is illustrated in Section 8.  \n \nEligibility  \nAt the time of application, the Saga Lifetime Mortgage  is only available to borrowers aged 55 and \nover.  \n \nThe minimum Initial Advance is \u00a310,000.00 , subject to your Property being acceptable to us and \nmeeting our minimum Property value requirements . \n \nInitial Advance  \nThis lifetime mortgage provides you with an Initial Advance of \u00a395,000.00  at Completion.  \n \nCash Facility  \nYou will be able to borrow up to the amount of your Cash Facility of  \u00a3137,500.00  (including the \nInitial Advance), unless certain  exceptional circumstances apply as described in Section 14.  \n \nWhen you have used all of your Cash Facility, or you wish to borrow more than is available, you can \nrequest us to increase the amount of your Cash Facility, but we a re not obliged to increase it .

Interest is charged daily and compounded monthly \n(or \u2018rolled-up\u2019) over the duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that \ninterest is charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The Amount Owed is \nusually repaid from the sale of the Property when you die or permanently \nleave the Property for Long Term Care. If you repay the Amount Owed before \nthis time, you may need to pay an Early Repayment Charge.\n1.

The Property as security\nYour lifetime mortgage is secured on the Property and the Amount \nOwed is usually repaid from the sale of the Property. Additional \nAdvances and other amounts added to the Amount Owed will \nincrease the amount of borrowing secured on the Property.\n8.1 The Amount Owed under your lifetime mortgage is secured on the \nProperty for the duration of your lifetime mortgage (that is, until \nyou have paid us the whole of the Amount Owed) regardless of any \nrepayments you make in the meantime.\n8.2 We require a first legal charge over the Property. When you have \nsigned and accepted your Offer and the Mortgage Deed, the legal \ncharge will be registered against the title to the Property at the \nLand Registry.\n8.3 If the Property is leasehold and you also own the freehold, we \nmay require a legal charge on the freehold and you must sign an \nappropriate deed for this purpose.\n8.4 If the Property is leasehold and you own a share of the freehold \nor management company, we may require an assignment of the \nshare or shares until you repay the Amount Owed and you must \nsign an appropriate deed for this purpose.

Interest\nThis section explains how the interest is applied to your lifetime \nmortgage. Interest is charged daily and \u2018rolled up\u2019 monthly over \nthe duration of your lifetime mortgage. This means that interest \nis charged on the interest as it \u2018rolls-up\u2019. The amount of interest \ncharged therefore increases as the interest \u2018rolls-up\u2019.  The amount of \ninterest charged, and how this increases over time, is illustrated in \nyour Offer. The Interest Rate for the Initial Advance is a fixed interest \nrate (a rate that will not change for the duration of your lifetime \nmortgage unless you elected to make Monthly Payments at the \nstart of your lifetime mortgage and subsequently stop making these \nMonthly Payments, please refer to Section 10.7). \n9.1 The Interest Rate on your Initial Advance is a fixed interest rate \nthat is shown in your Initial Advance Offer.\n9.2 The Interest Rate on each Additional Advance is a fixed interest \nrate that we agree at the time you request the Additional Advance. \nThe Interest Rate on the Additional Advance could be higher or \nlower than the Interest Rate on your Initial Advance. We provide  \nan Additional Advance Offer confirming the Interest Rate each  \ntime we agree to provide you with an Additional Advance.  98\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

In that case, you must do all \nyou reasonably can to make sure your freeholder or management \ncompany insures it.\n25.2  The insurance policy must:\na) be with a reputable insurer;\nb) cover at least the amount that is shown in the valuation report \nfor the rebuilding cost of the Property, which is designed to \ncover the amount (including Value Added Tax) required to \ndemolish and/or rebuild the Property, clear the site of the \nProperty, pay for surveyors and other professional fees and  \npay for alternative accommodation;\nc) be for an amount of cover that is adjusted each year in \naccordance with the House Rebuilding Cost Index or such  \nother index as we reasonably require;\nd) cover fire, subsidence, flood and other risks that we may from \ntime to time reasonably require;\ne) if you are purchasing the Property, be on risk immediately \nbefore exchange of contracts, or the date on which the \nAdvance is transferred to your legal adviser, whichever  \nis the earliest; and\nf) if you are re-mortgaging the Property, be on risk at least two \nBusiness Days before Completion of your lifetime mortgage.\n25.3  Our interest as a mortgage lender must be noted on the insurance \npolicy. If we have a valid reason, for example there has been a \nchange in insurance industry practice, we may ask for cover as \njoint insured (where we will each have an interest in the insurance) \nor co-insured on a composite basis (where our interests under the \ninsurance will be distinct). In the event we request cover on a joint \ninsured or on co-insured on a composite basis, we will provide you \nwith details of the type of policy we require. \n25.4  You must not do anything that will invalidate the insurance or \nwhich might entitle the insurer to either refuse to pay a claim or \nreduce the amount payable in respect of a claim, for example \ngiving false information to your insurer or leaving the Property \nunoccupied for more than the period of time specified in the \ninsurance policy.\n25.5  You must pay the insurance premiums on time.  You must show  \nus your insurance policy if we wish to see it and produce receipts or \nother evidence that it is on risk and the premiums are paid up  \nto date.25\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

Early Repayment Charges\nIf your lifetime mortgage is repaid early you may have to pay an \nEarly Repayment Charge. This is to protect us against the financial \nconsequences of you not keeping your lifetime mortgage for the full \nterm. The Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to \nus if your lifetime mortgage is repaid early.\nWe offer a two different Early Repayment Charge options; Variable \nand Fixed. The type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at \noutset. Once the Initial Advance has completed, the type of Early \nRepayment Charge cannot be changed and will be applicable to the \nInitial Advance and all subsequent Advances. Please refer to your \nOffer letter to understand which option applies to your Lifetime \nMortgage. \nFurther details on the Early Repayment Charge, including cash \nexamples are included in your Initial Advance Offer and each \nAdditional Advance Offer.

The way we calculate the Variable Early Repayment \nCharge is set out in your Offer.

Variations for Properties in Scotland \nDue to the different legal practices, if the Property is in Scotland \nthen this section will apply to you.\n55.1 In Section 6.1, there is a reference to tenants in common.  If \nthe Property is in Scotland, this means that the Property is in \njoint names but there is no survivorship clause in your title - and \nso each of you is able to dispose of your share of the Property \nas you wish rather than the share of one of you automatically \ntransferring to the survivor on the death of the first of you to die. \nIn Section 33.4, there is a reference to joint tenants and tenants \nin common. In Scotland, owners would not usually be referred \nto as tenants and these expressions are referring to ownership \nrather than tenancy.\n55.2  Where we refer to a legal charge, if the Property is in Scotland, \nthis means a standard security under the Conveyancing and \nFeudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (the 1970 Act). If we refer to a \nfirst legal charge, we mean a first standard security.\n55.3  In Section 8, Section 22, Section 23 and Section 25, there are \nreferences to the Property being leasehold.  This is rare for \na house in Scotland so it is unlikely that theprovisions that \nmention leaseholds will apply to you.

In Scotland, if the occupier is  \nyour spouse or civil partner, and you alone own the Property, \nhe or she will be required to sign the standard security, with \nthe help of a legal adviser, to signify his or her consent to your \ngranting it. This has the effect that our rights in relation to the \nProperty take precedence over the occupancy rights he or she \nmay otherwise have.\n55.6  Section 25 refers to exchange of contracts. In Scotland, the \nequivalent is conclusion of missives.\n55.7 Section 29.3 does not apply where the Property is in Scotland.\n55.8  If a Default Event occurs, you will be held to be in default within \nthe meaning of condition 9(1)(b) of the standard conditions \nset out in Schedule 3 to the 1970 Act and we can enter into \npossession of the Property in accordance with the 1970 Act,  \nsell the Property using the power of sale conferred by the 1970 \nAct and exercise any other power conferred on creditors by the \n1970 Act.\n55.9  There is no provision in the 1970 Act for the appointment of a \nproperty receiver and so references in Section 44.1(d), Section \n45, Section 46 and Section 47 to a receiver, do not apply.\n55.10  5Subject to the provisions of the 1970 Act, we may decide to do \nall or any of the things that we say an appointed receiver can \ndecide to do in Section 45.5, Section 45.6 will apply to costs that \nwe incur in doing any of these things and Section 45.8 will apply, \napart from the reference to a receiver.\n55.11  We have the power of sale and other powers from the 1970 Act. \nFor example, we will have the power to insure the Property. We \nmay exercise the power of sale if a Default Event occurs. If we \ntake some action in relation to the Property but have not taken \npossession of it we will not be a heritable creditor in possession. \nThis means that you will still be responsible for the Property, for \nexample, insuring the Property. If we have to sell the Property, \nwe may remove any personal belongings that you leave behind. \nWe may store, sell or dispose of them for you as your agent. \nYou will need to pay any Costs we incur. If you fail to pay those \nCosts when we ask, we will add them to the Amount Owed, and \ninterest will apply to those Costs. If the Property is sold by us, it \ncan be sold as a whole or in parts. We may sell by auction or by \nprivate sale and the money will be payable to us in a lump sum, \nin instalments or a partial payment. If we sell the Property, we \ncan make any conditions we think are necessary and can vary or \neven withdraw from any contract for sale. If we sell the Property \nand the Sale Proceeds of the Property exceed the Amount Owed, \nassuming there is no-one with a prior right, anything left over \nwill be given to you for the benefit of you or your beneficiaries.\nCall 01737 233297  or visit wearejust.co.uk"}

This must be drawn on completion of the \nlifetime mortgage. The initial advance will be paid to the account of the \ncustomer\u2019s legal adviser. If any part of the initial advance is needed to  \npay off an outstanding mortgage or secured loan, this amount will be  \npaid directly to the lender. All payments will be made in sterling. \nCash facility \nCustomers have the option of taking a cash facility at the start of their \nlifetime mortgage. The interest rate applicable to the initial advance and any \nsubsequent borrowing will be higher than if this option were not selected. \nThe maximum cash facility will be capped at the maximum LTV available \nbased on the age of the youngest customer (with an absolute maximum of \n\u00a3200,000 remaining in the facility). The unused cash facility will therefore be \nthe balance of the maximum loan amount permitted by customer age less \nthe initial advance.\nThe cash facility is guaranteed to be available for the life of the mortgage, \nunless one of the following occurs: \n \u2022If the total of all the advances exceeds the maximum loan amount based \non the borrowers age and property value at the time the request for an \nadditional advance is made.\n \u2022If we, or another provider (if we have transferred the lifetime mortgage \nto them in accordance with your lifetime mortgage agreement) no longer \noffers lifetime mortgages.\n \u2022If the amount owed exceeds 100% of the value of the property at the time \nthe request for an additional advance is made.\n \u2022If the property is owned on a tenants in common basis (or, in Scotland, \nthere is no survivorship destination in the title to the property), and either \nparty has died.\n \u2022If a default event occurs.\n \u2022If, amongst other things, we become insolvent, are no longer authorised \nby the FCA, the FCA (or any other body responsible for regulating our \nbusiness) has placed limits on our ability to lend or there are changes to \nour costs of funding (for example the cost in administering our mortgages \nor the cost of funding our lending) which results in it being uneconomical \nfor us to provide the additional advance.\n \u2022If a second charge has been registered on the property.We sometimes accept applications on \nbehalf of individuals by attorneys.

Any \nreplacement offer will be in line with the terms available at the time, so the \ninterest rate may change. Interest is charged on a monthly basis and added \nto the outstanding balance each month on the payment due date. Interest \nis charged from the date the advance is released to the borrower\u2019s legal \nadviser, until the date the amount owed is repaid in full, or in the event of \nearly repayment until the latter of either the date the amount owed is repaid \nin full or if repaid before the end of the 14 day notice period until the end of \nthat notice period.\nFor additional advances the interest rate will be set at the time it\u2019s requested. \nCustomers will be informed of the rate in writing.

Therefore if the customer is \nservicing 100% of the monthly interest amount, the balance in the table in \nsection 8 may include some interest. For example, if a customer completes \ntheir initial advance on 2 January 2021 and has chosen to service 100% \nof their monthly interest amount with a payment date of the 15th of each \nmonth, section 8 of the KFI would show in year 1 the balance at the end of  \n2 January 2022. By this date interest has accumulated from 15 December \n2021 (the last payment) to 2 January 2022. However the customer hasn\u2019t had \na chance to pay that off as their direct debit date isn\u2019t until 15 January 2022. \nTherefore the interest that has been accumulated is included in the balance  \nin section 8.\nFees, remuneration and charges \nTo find out more about fees, remuneration and charges, see our \u2018Just For You \nLifetime Mortgage \u2013 at a glance\u2019 guide.

For example, your customer might move into a \ncare home or live with and be cared for by relatives on a permanent basis \ndue to medical necessity. \nIf the mortgage isn\u2019t repaid within 12 months, we may appoint  \na representative to market and sell the property. \nIf the mortgage is repaid at any time before the death or entry into \npermanent long-term care of all applicants, then the customer(s)  \nmay have to pay an early repayment charge. \nThe mortgage may also have to be repaid if the property is left vacant  \nfor more than three months. \nUsually the mortgage will be repaid from the sale proceeds of the property, \nbut it can be repaid from other funds if needed. \nVoluntary early repayment \nIf your customer(s) repay their lifetime mortgage early, there may be an \nearly repayment charge to pay. This is to protect us against the financial \nconsequences of their decision not to keep the mortgage for the full term. \nWe do not charge an exit administration fee for early repayment. \nThe Early Repayment Charge is designed to reflect the cost to us if the \nlifetime mortgage is repaid early.   \nWe offer two different Early Repayment Charge options: Variable and Fixed.  \nThe type of Early Repayment Charge must be chosen at outset.

For \neach advance, they can pay back up to 10% of the advance amount in each \n12-month period following completion, in up to six instalments providing they \nare not servicing any of the monthly interest amount. The minimum overall \namount they can pay in each instalment is \u00a3500, and the remaining amount \nowed must be at least \u00a310,000. \nIf more than one advance has been taken, we will allocate the amount \nrepaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. If the amount \nrepaid is more than 10% there may be an early repayment charge payable. \nAlso, if the customer(s) sell their property and transfers the lifetime \nmortgage to a new property that is acceptable to us, we may ask them to \nmake a part repayment. This may happen, for example, if the customer(s) \nnew property is worth less than their existing one.

We choose a surveyor to carry out the valuation. \nMoving home \nIf your customers want to move home, it may be possible to transfer their \nlifetime mortgage to a new property, if the new property is acceptable to us. \nOne condition is that the sale of the old property and purchase of the new \nproperty take place at the same time. \nIf the new property has a higher value than the old property, it may be \npossible to apply for a further advance. But this is subject to the lending \ncriteria at the time. \nIn some instances, for example if the customer is transferring the lifetime \nmortgage to a lower value property, we may reduce the cash facility. \nWe may ask the customer to repay part of the amount owed in line with \nlending criteria applicable at the time. We do not charge an application \nfee for transferring the lifetime mortgage. \nIf the customer has taken more than one advance, we will allocate the \namount repaid in proportion to the amount owed on each advance. There \nwill be no early repayment charge in these circumstances. If customers \nchoose to repay more than required, an early repayment charge will apply \nonly to the extra amount repaid. \nThe new property will need to be valued by a surveyor. We\u2019ll choose a \nsurveyor to do the valuation. The valuation fee will be the fee applicable  \nto a new Just Lifetime Mortgage at the time. \nYour customer will be responsible for all the costs of moving.

You are required to \r\nexplain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.  The provider \r\nwill not complete the transaction until they have received a Certificate which has been signed and completed by \r\nboth you and your client(s), whereby you confirm that you have drawn your client\u2019s(s\u2019) attention to the risks of \r\nentering into an equity release transaction and your client(s) confirms that he/they has/have been given the advice \r\nset out in the Certificate.\r\nGuidance on Independence \r\nClients must use a legal adviser who is independent of the provider\u2019s solicitor.  If you are advising a client in relation \r\nto an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent \r\nof the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013\r\n \r\n\u00b7 the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or \r\nWales); or\r\n\u00b7 the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\r\n\u00b7 the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of \r\nScotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which \r\ntake place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s \r\nRules & Guidance\r\nPayment of Fees \r\nWhilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to \r\nthis guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients \r\nto you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to \r\nyou.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not \r\nbe calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.\r\nThis also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected \r\nwith the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative \r\nor marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel \r\nmembership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of \r\nstaff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision \r\nor purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).  For the avoidance of doubt, certain \r\nmarketing payments which are not connected with payment on a case-by-case basis are permitted, subject to the \r\nregulatory obligations of the parties concerned. You must inform your client(s) in writing of the amount and \r\nfrequency of any financial arrangement, including marketing contributions, when issuing the customer case \r\ndocumentation at the outset.\r\nIf the customer chooses not to instruct their own legal adviser, the adviser or provider (as appropriate) may offer \r\nthe name of at least one local law firm which has knowledge of equity release products.  The adviser or provider \r\nmust ensure that no pressure or financial inducement is involved in directing customers to any particular law firm \r\neither by them or the intermediaries recommending their products.\r\nReceipt of Payments \r\nIf you are acting on behalf of the client you may not receive payments or other consideration from the adviser or \r\nprovider if that payment is dependent on the completion of an equity release transaction.

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\r\naware of the possible consequences:\r\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\r\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\r\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\r\nseeking.\r\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\r\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\r\nthe gift.\r\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\r\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\r\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\r\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from Infinity Mortgages and it may be that you have already\r\naddressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we\r\nrecommend that you do so.  \r\nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. Once you have\r\ncompleted the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. Please be aware that I will not be able to\r\ncomplete your equity release until I am in receipt of a completed and signed form.\r\n \r\nPlease contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand or if you would like to discuss\r\nin more detail.\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nJordan Swinburn\r\njordan.swinburn@equilaw.uk.com\r\nTo book a call with me visit callbooking.equilaw.uk.com/JordanSwinburn\r\n "}

Please read this information carefully and return the instruction form on the last page to us duly completed. If you\r\nhave any queries please contact us to discuss.\r\nJoint Tenancy\r\nThe property is not owned in specified shares, but jointly own the whole.  If one of the joint owners dies, their interest passes\r\nautomatically to the surviving owner(s).  This right of survivorship overrides any Will the deceased owner may have made.\r\nCouples who are divorcing or separating must seriously consider whether the joint tenancy should be severed in order to prevent this\r\nright of survivorship operating.  By severing the joint tenancy, the owners automatically become tenants in common (as discussed below)\r\nand this would enable them to leave their interest in the property to whom they choose in their Will.\r\nIf the property is to be sold, and there is no agreement over the division in the proceeds of sale, the Courts would have to be involved to\r\nmake a decision. \r\nTenancy in Common\r\nThe property is jointly owned in specific shares e.g. 50/50.  When one of the owners dies, their interest passes according to the\r\nDeceased\u2019s wishes expressed in their Will (or according to the law of intestacy).\r\nWhat if a jointly owning couple separate?\r\nIf a married couple are divorcing, the Family Court has wide powers to order a financial settlement under s.25 Matrimonial Causes Act\r\n1973.  The powers include an order for sale of a property or one spouse transferring their interest in the property to the other.  These\r\npowers only come in to play in the event of a divorce.  The UK Courts do not recognise any form of agreement or attempt to override the\r\nCourt\u2019s powers such as a \u201cPre-Nuptual Agreement\u201d.\r\nUnmarried couples, living together, can also make claims against each other should the relationship end and they are unable to agree\r\nhow the property should be dealt with.  Court proceedings can be brought under Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996. \r\nThe Court will consider how long the parties have been together, each party\u2019s financial contribution to the property and their way of life\r\ne.g. how domestic and utility bills have been paid, redecoration carried out and gardens landscaped etc.\r\nA Declaration of Trust can be entered into upon purchasing the property which sets out the proposed property division for each party\r\nshould the relationship end.  The Court is not bound by this Declaration and may view it simply as an intention of mind at the time when\r\nit was entered into.  The Declaration is one of many factors the Court will consider and which can be overridden by the Court, especially if\r\nthe relationship has been a long one.\r\nIn recent years partners have entered into written Cohabitation Agreements (also known as Living Together Agreements), as above the\r\nCourt would view these as an intention of mind at the time they were entered into, and would not bind a Court.\r\nBusiness Property\r\nWhere a property is purchased by two or more partners as a business enterprise, it is normally acquired by the partners as Tenants In\r\nCommon.  It is then advisable to stipulate the percentage share of each partner. Most Equity Release providers stipulate that the\r\nproperty must not be used for business, although there are specific Buy to Let equity release products available.\r\nWhat if a joint owner becomes bankrupt?\r\nThe Bankrupt\u2019s interest in the property passes initially to the Official Receiver as interim Receiver and Manager and subsequently either\r\nstays with the Official Receiver, or is passed to a private sector Licensed Insolvency Practioner, as a Trustee in Bankruptcy.\r\nWhere the property is owned as Joint Tenants there is a presumption that the interest which passes into the Bankruptcy is 50%.  Where\r\nthere is a Tenancy in Common specifying the share, then the Bankrupt owner\u2019s share enters into the Bankruptcy and nothing else. "}

These fraudsters have realised\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\ninterception. \nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\nWhat should you be looking out for?\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\nHow can you protect yourself?\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!"}

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\r\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\r\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\r\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \r\nnot have\r\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\r\nForm.\r\nEnclosed is our \r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n sheet and \r\nCybercrime Leaflet\r\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\r\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\r\nnotify us to the contrary.\r\n \r\nScope of Work\r\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\r\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\r\nFinancial Adviser Infinity Mortgages, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let me know\r\nso that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\r\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \r\nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\r\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\r\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \r\nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\r\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \r\nfirst and only\r\n legal charge (mortgage) to\r\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\r\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\r\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \r\nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\r\n launched by the\r\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\r\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\r\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\r\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\r\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\r\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\r\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\r\nTax or Financial advice\r\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\r\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\r\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\r\nCharges\r\nIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your Equity Release.\r\nFees and Expenses\r\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3749.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\r\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\r\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\r\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\r\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\r\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\r\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\r\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\r\nDisbursements\r\nDisbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control.\r\nWe may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard Equity Release matter (and"}

As soon as we are aware of any we will notify you.\r\nSigned Plan\r\nPlease find enclosed a plan, obtained from the Land Registry, outlining what I believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return\r\nto me.  If the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent.  It is important that the plan is accurate. If you own any additional land, please\r\nidentify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct.\r\nNext Steps\r\nPlease review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to\r\nenable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to Equilaw such as account details for existing charges,\r\ndetails of any occupiers or your management company (if Leasehold) details.  On receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer\r\nthrough to completion. The offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lender\u2019s solicitors (who will then send it to us).\r\nWe will issue and send you a \"\r\nLegal Report Pack\". \r\nThis pack will come directly from Equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you will\r\nreceive from Legal & General Home Finance directly.\r\nOffers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. We will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from Legal & General\r\nHome Finance's solicitors. We have to await this pack of documents as it contains the legal documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our\r\nsolicitor. On average there is a delay of approximately 3 working days between you receive the offer and us. If we have not contacted you after 3 days\r\n(from your receipt of the offer directly from Legal & General Home Finance) please contact me so that I may chase Legal & General Home Finance's\r\nsolicitors for this documentation.\r\nOnce we receive the offer from Legal & General Home Finance's solicitors, we will contact you to book a face to face appointment will our attending\r\nsolicitor. \r\nWe have produced a short information video demonstrating how the appointment can safely proceed \r\nhttps://youtu.be/e3GRm6PP4FM\r\n. We would urge\r\nyou to review the video so that you know what to expect and so that you can raise any question or queries relating to the appointment.\r\nWe have been successfully conducting meetings in this manner since the start of the pandemic, so you are in safe hands with Equilaw. We are: \r\nclosely following Public Health England and NHS guidance,  \r\nasking our attending solicitors to self-certify weekly that they have not (to the best of their knowledge) come into contact with any \u2018at risk\u2019\r\nindividuals,  \r\narranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; \r\nre-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; \r\nadapting our face to face meetings\r\n \r\nto be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; \r\nensuring that all staff are issued with PPE and sanitiser. \r\nWe believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the ERC Guidelines, adhere to the Law of\r\nProperty Act requirements, adhere to the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. \r\nIf you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know.  It is a matter for you to\r\ndecide if you wish to proceed.\u00e2\u20ac\u00af If there are additional precautions that can be taken to minimise any risk of infection to you, please let us know.  \r\nIt is mandatory, under Law of Property Act 1925, for a deed to be lawfully executed that it MUST be executed in the presence of a physically\r\npresent independent person. Deeds cannot, under any circumstances, be executed via video call.    \r\nOnce we have booked the appointment, we will send to you our \r\n\u201cLegal Report Pack\u201d.\r\n  This pack contains the documents that you will need to sign in the\r\npresence of our solicitor and without it the appointment cannot proceed.   \r\nIf you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us.\r\n \r\nCompletion\r\nWe will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the Lender to seek your authorisation to complete. As the action rests with Legal & General\r\nHome Finance\u2019s solicitors to carry out their pre-completion checks we cannot give a precise time estimate.\r\nOur final bill and completion statement will be sent to you following completion.  We will pay your net funds directly into your bank account by BACS in\r\nthree days. If you wish to obtain your funds on the same day as completion we are able to offer a premium same day service if at an additional cost of \u00a340\r\n+VAT.  Please notify us if you do want to upgrade to the premium payment service and we will amend our records, but please note that funds are usually\r\nnot received from the lenders solicitors until mid-afternoon on the day of completion, such that same day transfer to you is not always possible. There are\r\ncertain parts of the transaction where we must use same day bank transfer, for example, paying off an existing charge and this is beyond our control.\r\n \r\nAfter Completion\r\nAny original documents will be returned to you after completion.  We will store our file for 6 years, as required by our regulators, after which time the file\r\nwill be confidentially destroyed.\r\nWe can offer extended secure off site storage of your file for 30 years at a cost of \u00a325 plus VAT, if you so wish.   If you wish to take up this service, please\r\nlet us know before completion."}

It \nis down to You to decide whether that insurance is also suitable for You (and for anyone else who might have an interest in the Property), and to arrange any additional insurance that You may nee d. \n4.8.10  If We insure the Property that will be a Cost You must pay.  \n4.8.11  You must take reasonable steps to make sure that nothing happens which may \nharm the ability to make a claim under the insurance.  \n4.8.12  You must tell us straight away if any significant damage happens  to the Property \nand You will need to make a claim. Where the insurance allows, We will have a right to negotiate with the insurer and settle a claim on reasonable terms.  \n4.9 Proceeds from insurance  claims  \nYou must ensure that all money payable under any insurance in respect of loss or damage to the Property, whether effected or maintained pursuant to paragraph 4.8 above or otherwise, shall be paid to Us or, if it is paid to You, You must hold all money received on trust for Us.

This means  that if You have  more than one property  \nmortgaged to Us and You want  to pay off just one of those mortgages,  We can refuse to redeem  \nthe mortgages  separately  and insist  that You pay off all of them,  before redeeming any of them.  \n6 Using Our  rights  \n6.1 Where  You need Our consent  under  these Conditions  before doing  something,  We will not \nunreasonably  withhold  or delay  that consent.  For example,  it will be reasonable for Us to refuse  \nto consent to something We reasonably think  will: \n6.1.1  make it less likely You can pay Us all Amounts Owed at any  time;  \n6.1.2  negatively affect Our Mortgage or the value of the Property;  or \n6.1.3  have any significant negative impact on Us in relation to the Mortgage.  \nWhere  You need Our consent  before doing  something,  You will need it before going  ahead and \nYou should therefore ask for consent in good time before going  ahead.  \n6.2 Where:  \n6.2.1  We have the power to require You to take or not to take certain action;   \n6.2.2  something must be to Our satisfaction or must be acceptable to  Us; or  \n6.2.3  or a document must be in Our required form,  \nthen, unless otherwise specified, We will act reasonably when exercising these rights.  For \nexample,  We will be acting  reasonably  if We act as a prudent  lender  would.  \n7 Enforcement of security \n7.1 Powers to be exercisable without  restrictions  \n7.1.1  Section 103 of the Act shall not apply  to the Mortgage.  Failure to pay the Secured  \nSums  as and when  they become  due or any other  breach  by You of the covenants  \nand conditions contained in the Mortgage or in the Loan Agreement, shall  result  in \nthe Mortgage becoming enforceable and the powers conferred upon Us by  the Act \nand the Mortgage becoming immediately exercisable without the restrictions  \ncontained in the Act as to the giving  of notice or otherwise with respect  to the whole  \nor any part of the Property. Section 103 of the Act says that We cannot use Our \npower  to sell the Property  until certain  conditions  have been  met. If We did not \ndisapply  them,  the conditions  would  mean,  for example,  that if We issued a notice  \nasking You  to make  a payment,  We would  have  to give you three months  to make  \nthe payment before exercising Our right to sell. \n7.1.2  In connection  with exercising  Our powers,  in Our discretion,  We may appoint  You \nor Your Personal Representative(s) as Our agent to market the Property on Our \nbehalf.

What is a lifetime mortgage?\r\nImportant Information From The Financial Conduct Authority:\r\n\u2022A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life,\r\nand which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or\r\na regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the\r\nsale of your home after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death\r\nof the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries.\r\n\u2022If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or\r\nyou may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay the\r\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Any money left\r\nover belongs to you.\r\n\u2022If you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the\r\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Again, any\r\nmoney left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs\r\nto move into long-term care, you don\u2019t usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either\r\ndies or moves into long-term care or another property.\r\n\u2022If you decide that you simply don\u2019t want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount\r\nyou owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do.\r\nSection 13 of this Offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage.\r\n\u2022Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment \u2013 this means you borrow a lump sum which is\r\ninvested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the full details of\r\nthe investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents\r\ntogether.\r\n4.

No fees have been added to this amount,\r\nbut the fees you need to pay are shown in Section 11. For details of any insurance charges, see\r\nSection 12.\r\n\u2022The remainder of your cash facility that is not drawn down at the start of your mortgage is subject to\r\na minimum draw down amount of \u00a32,000.00 each time (or the full amount of the remaining facility\r\nif less than \u00a32,000.00), and is also subject to the conditions described in Section 5. Charges may be\r\napplicable to further draw downs, as described in the Tariff of Charges.\r\n\u2022Changes to any of the information you have given us, could alter the information in this Offer.

Description of this mortgage\r\nThis Offer is for a Capital Choice Midi Drawdown provided by more 2 life Limited. Your mortgage includes\r\na cash facility as discussed with your adviser. It provides you with a cash lump sum at the start of the loan\r\nand a cash facility which you may be able to draw cash from after your initial lump sum loan completion,\r\nsubject to a minimum withdrawal of \u00a32,000.00 or withdrawal of the remaining facility if less than \u00a32,000.00.\r\nThe amount of this facility is not guaranteed and we may reduce or remove this facility at any time. You\r\ncan apply direct to more 2 life Limited for further borrowing of the remaining amount of this facility without\r\nfurther financial advice. Any such further borrowing will be based on your property value and the terms\r\nand interest rates available from more 2 life Limited at the time. In particular, the interest rate applied to\r\nsuch further borrowing may be more or less than your initial interest rate. You do not have to make any\r\npayments during the life of this lifetime mortgage.\r\nCircumstances in which the cash facility may be reduced or removed include:\r\n\u2022 Where the total of all cash advances, rolled-up interest and other charges exceeds the maximum\r\nloan applicable at the time of applying to use the cash facility, based on your age and property\r\nvalue at the time.\r\n\u2022 Where you are in default under the mortgage conditions.\r\n\u2022 Where we no longer Offer new lifetime mortgages such as this one.\r\n\u2022 Where there are more than one of you and the property is owned by you as tenants in common\r\nbut one of you has died and not all appropriate documentation satisfactory to us has been provided\r\nto ensure the mortgage will secure the amount owed including the cash advance.\r\nAny such further borrowing will be subject to the interest rate available from more 2 life Limited at the time\r\nof application, which shall be based on the interest rates which would be applied by more 2 life Limited\r\nat such time to any new borrowing. This interest rate may be more or less than your initial interest rate. The\r\nOffer that we give to you at the time of any cash advance will set out the interest rate for that cash\r\nadvance.\r\nThis lifetime mortgage can only be arranged for either one or two people between the ages of 55 - 84,\r\nbased on the age of the youngest applicant, who own and live permanently in the property which is\r\nsubject to the lifetime mortgage.\r\nIf there are any other outstanding mortgages or charges at the time the loan is taken out, you will be\r\nrequired to use the lifetime mortgage to clear these loans. As part of the completion process our solicitors\r\nwill redeem them with the proceeds from the loan.\r\nInterest is charged at a fixed rate of 7.91% on the initial advance until receipt by more 2 life Limited of all\r\nmonies due. The interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly, meaning the interest rolls up\r\nwith interest being charged on that interest, paid when you repay your loan. See Section 8 for example.\r\nAny cash advances will be subject to the new interest rate payable at the time and set out in the Offer\r\nthat we give you for that cash advance, and which will then be fixed for the lifetime of the loan.\r\nWe have based this Offer on an estimated term of 18 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime\r\nmortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 18 years. If you are still living in your home at\r\nthe end of 18 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run.\r\nThe loan, accrued interest and charges that may be due, become payable out of the proceeds from the\r\nsale of your home under the following circumstances;\r\n\u2022 On your death, or (if joint borrowers) on the death of the last borrower.\r\n\u2022 If you move home and transferring this lifetime mortgage to the new property does not meet our\r\nlending conditions.\r\n\u2022If you move into residential or long-term care on the grounds of medical or other specialist advice.\r\nAny money left over would be paid to you or your beneficiaries.\r\nThe maximum amount you can borrow in one lump sum is \u00a3191,625.00. If you require additional funds you\r\nmay apply for further secured borrowing at any time subject to availability - see Section 14 for details.\r\nCC v1.33 1121 Page 4 of 15"}

The FCA require that this Offer is on an estimated term, as detailed in Section 5, but remember that the\r\nactual term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter. If you are still living in your\r\nown home at the end of this term, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run and the amount you owe\r\nwill continue to increase.\r\n2. more 2 life Limited has the right to take legal action to repossess your house in the following\r\ncircumstances:\r\n(a) the property not being sold within 12 months of your death (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the\r\ndeath of the last borrower) or your entering long-term care (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the last\r\nborrower entering long-term care) or otherwise vacating the property; (b) compulsory purchase or\r\nrequisition of all or any part of the property; (c) false information or omission in information given to more\r\n2 life Limited, including fraud or money laundering; (d) any failure to notify and co-operate with more 2\r\nlife Limited in relation to an environmental notice issued under the provisions of the Environmental\r\nProtection Act 1990 or the Water Resources Act 1991 relating to your property or a neighbouring property;\r\n(e) you use or permit the property to be used otherwise than solely as a private residence; (f) you are or\r\nbecome bankrupt or enter into a composition or other arrangement with any of your creditors or you have\r\nbeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been engaged in criminal activity; or (g) you\r\nare in default under the mortgage conditions.\r\n3. If negative equity arises, this will be dealt with under the no Negative Equity Guarantee as set out in\r\nSection 6. If your home is sold for more than the outstanding lifetime mortgage balance, which includes\r\ninterest, any unpaid charges and costs, you or your estate will receive the difference.\r\n4. If you move home and want to transfer this lifetime mortgage to the new property, you can do so if the\r\nnew property meets our lending conditions. You will have to pay a Valuation Fee, Arrangement Fee and\r\nour and your legal expenses in respect of the new property. If the new property is of a lower value, we\r\nmay ask you to repay part of the amount outstanding on the lifetime mortgage.\r\n5. If you move out of your home into long-term care or residential care your home must be sold and the\r\nlifetime mortgage repaid. Early repayment charges do not apply if this happens - they are only payable\r\nif you choose to repay your lifetime mortgage early. Section 13 of this Offer tells you when they are\r\npayable.\r\n6. If you want someone else to move into your home to live with you, for example; upon marriage/the\r\nformation of a civil partnership, or where someone acts as your carer, you must first get more 2 life Limited\r\nto agree before they move in. Otherwise this will breach the terms of your mortgage. Any persons that\r\nare currently residing at the property and are not party to the loan may have to sign a waiver in order to\r\ncontinue living in the property.\r\n7. You must keep your home in good repair. If you do not keep your home in good repair, more 2 life\r\nLimited has the right to inspect the property and get the repairs done, but they will tell you first if they\r\nintend to do this. The cost of any repairs that more 2 life Limited has to arrange will be added to the amount\r\nyou owe on this lifetime mortgage. Where such costs are not able to be reclaimed on the sale of the\r\nproperty, they may be excluded from the no Negative Equity Guarantee (see Section 6).\r\n8. Taking out this mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits, and may also affect\r\nyour tax position. Tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need\r\nfurther advice you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, the Pension Service, Benefits Agency or your\r\nlocal Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau.\r\n9. The property must currently be mortgage free, or if there is a mortgage outstanding then this must be\r\neither repaid before or at the time the lifetime mortgage begins. You can use the funds released through\r\nthe lifetime mortgage to do this, but no second or subsequent mortgages over the property will be allowed\r\nat any time.\r\n10. Once the mortgage has been set up, you will not be able to add another person to it, even if your\r\ncircumstances change.\r\n11. You have an obligation to maintain buildings insurance on the property that the loan is secured against\r\nwhich must be adequate to cover the cost of rebuilding the property for that period of cover, and note\r\nour interest on the property in the policy.\r\n12. We may be willing to lend you more in the future, but we have no obligation to do so. Any further\r\nborrowing (including drawings of your remaining cash facility) will be based on the prevailing lending\r\ncriteria. The amount of your cash facility is not guaranteed and the facility may be reduced or withdrawn\r\nat any time. Please see Section 5 for further details.\r\n13. Interest rates may go up before you draw down additional borrowing from your cash facility, and the\r\ninterest rate you receive from us in respect of any additional borrowing may reflect this.

If the amount\r\nremaining in your cash facility is less than \u00a32,000, this must be withdrawn in full. Any withdrawal from your\r\ncash facility is subject to your lifetime mortgage agreement and will be based on more 2 life\u2019s lending\r\ncriteria at the time.\r\nA different fixed interest rate may be applied to subsequent borrowing from your cash facility, which shall\r\nbe based on the interest rates which would be applied by more 2 life Limited at such time to any new\r\nborrowing. The interest rate applicable to such subsequent borrowing may be more or less than your initial\r\ninterest rate. We will provide you with an Offer confirming the interest rate and the APR each time we\r\nagree to your request for additional borrowing.\r\nThe following example shows how your lifetime mortgage could change over the example term of\r\n18 years if you borrowed the whole of your cash facility on completion of your lifetime mortgage.

The amount available will depend upon the current value of your home,\r\nyour age, the condition of the property at time of application and the outstanding loan balance.\r\nAdditional funds are not guaranteed at any time during the life of the loan.\r\nThis will increase the amount of borrowing secured on your home.\r\nAdditional fees may apply which are detailed in the Tariff of Charges applicable at the time of application.\r\nOverpayments\r\nYou can make partial repayments of up to 10% of the initial loan amount within each 12 month period,\r\nstarting from the date your loan completes, without incurring an early repayment charge. If unused the\r\n10% partial repayment amount cannot be carried forward in whole or part to subsequent 12 month\r\nperiods.

Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\n \nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\nIndemnity Insurance\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.

Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.

Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax.

If you would like us to start work before the cancellation (cooling off) period ends you will need to confirm this to us during\nour initial telephone conversation with you.\nTermination of the Retainer\nYou may end your instructions to us in writing at any time, but we may keep your papers and documents while there is still money owed to us\nfor fees and disbursements subject to your rights to cancel within the 14 day cooling off period.  We may decide to stop acting for you only\nwith good reason and we must give you reasonable notice that we intend to stop acting for you. If you or we decide that we should stop\nacting for you, you will not be charged for our work directly in relation to your equity release application but you must pay for all\ndisbursement costs incurred.  If we have agreed with you that our fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication you will remain liable to pay for any additional work undertaken.  \nWhere there is an associated conveyancing transaction that does not proceed to completion we may charge you a percentage of our overall\nestimated charge as follows: Instructions received from you but no preparation/receipt of draft contract = 15%; Contract issued/received =\n65%; Contract and searches received, reviewed and reported to you upon = 80%; point of exchange of contracts = 90%.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128504", "filename": "128504/15.pdf", "page_num": 6, "text": "FAQ\n1. \nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\n10. \nWhen will you be in touch with me? \nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next."}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\r\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \r\nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\r\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\r\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\r\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\r\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\r\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\r\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\r\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \r\nYour Responsibilities\r\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\r\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\r\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\r\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \r\nOur Charges\r\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\r\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\r\non your behalf (disbursements).  \r\nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\r\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\r\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\r\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\r\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\r\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\r\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\r\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\r\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\r\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\r\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\r\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\r\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\r\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\r\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\r\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\r\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\r\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\r\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\r\n \r\nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\r\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\r\nIndemnity Insurance\r\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\r\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\r\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\r\nthe additional fees schedule.\r\nShortfall\r\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\r\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\r\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\r\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\r\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\r\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\r\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\r\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible."}

We are required, by law, to verify your identity and address and additionally, to secure your\nequity release funds, we must \u201cguarantee\u201d your identity to the lenders.  We can only do this by reference to government issued photographic\nidentification documentation e.g. valid driving licence, passport or shooting licence. Unless we specifically ask please do not send your identification to us\nas our solicitor will take copies at your appointment. If you do \nnot have\n such documentation we will require you to complete our Identity Verification\nForm.\nEnclosed is our \nFrequently Asked Questions\n sheet and \nCybercrime Leaflet\n which provide further information on how we safeguard against fraud.  Please\nnote that we may need to share elements of your personal data with our mail service providers and we assume that you consent to do this unless you\nnotify us to the contrary.\n \nScope of Work\nEquilaw Ltd are instructed to carry out the legal aspects of the Equity Release transaction and any associated work on your behalf. We cannot give you any\nadvice relating to the suitability of the financial product selected. If you have any queries regarding the financial product speak to your independent\nFinancial Adviser Infinity Mortgages, who can advise further. If you do require financial advice, before progressing your Equity Release, please let me know\nso that I can place your transaction on hold until you are ready to proceed.\nThe property valuation report is not shared with us, therefore any issues regarding the report should be addressed with the IFA in the first instance. \nOrdinarily the valuation is valid for completion within 6 months.  As we do not see this report we cannot diarise the expiration date, so we recommend\nthat you do so and if you can notify us of the date we can put a process in place to avoid any problems.  The latest we can send documentation to the\nlenders to request completion within the validity date is two weeks prior, for a standard equity release transaction. \nIf the valuation expires a re-valuation may be required and this may require an additional fee to be paid.\nEquity Release involves releasing equity from your home which, in the case of a lifetime mortgage, will require a \nfirst and only\n legal charge (mortgage) to\nbe registered on your property title at the Land Registry, with no other third party interest.\nHomes for Ukraine Campaign\nYou will, no doubt, have seen the recently announced \u201cHomes for Ukraine Scheme\u201d \nhttps://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk\n launched by the\nGovernment, allowing UK homeowners to offer shelter to displaced Ukrainian families.  It is extremely important that you are aware that you MUST inform\nyour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If you fail to do so, you will immediately\nbreach the terms and conditions of your mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to remediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any\nloss as a result of such an occupier moving in with you, they can pursue you for that loss.  Currently, there is very little clarity around the Homes for\nUkraine scheme and no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine, which means any such families may require housing support for far longer than the\ninitial 6 months suggested by the Government.  Lenders are therefore likely to take a risk-based approach to offering consent, which may not be granted in\nall cases.  If you have any questions, or you are already considering offering space in your home to refugees, please let us know immediately.\nTax or Financial advice\nWe are neither authorised nor regulated to provide tax or financial advice.  Therefore, if the purpose of the loan is to reduce your inheritance tax liability,\nwe strongly advise that you seek independent tax and financial planning advice from a suitably qualified expert before making any decisions about giving\naway the proceeds, or investing them, as your actions may otherwise fail to achieve your preferred (or required) outcome.\nCharges\nIf you have any secured loans, overdrafts or Mortgages you must let us know immediately to avoid any delays to your Equity Release.\nFees and Expenses\nPlease see our attached estimated bill to deal with your Equity Release. We have agreed an all-inclusive fee of \u00a3749.00. The all-inclusive fee is based on the\nassumption that your case is straight-forward. The fixed fee covers our legal fees, land registry fees, redemption of a first charge, solicitors signing\nappointment, postage, archive of your file for 6 years and VAT.\nThe fees have been estimated based on the present information available to me and on the assumption that your equity release transaction has no\nunusual features. Should your case have any additional features, additional fees are charged according to the nature of the issues we need to resolve. Our\nadditional fees sheet is annexed for your information, We will notify you if additional work is required in order to satisfy your Equity Release lender's\nrequirement. Any additional fee work is classified as non-standard work, and even if the equity release does not complete, the additional charge remains\npayable. Ordinarily the fees will be paid on completion from the Equity Release funds.\nDisbursements\nDisbursements are necessary \"out of pocket expenses\" which are subject to change and outside of our control.\nWe may need to request advance payment for any additional disbursements that are required in excess of a standard Equity Release matter (and\n2"}

As soon as we are aware of any we will notify you.\nSigned Plan\nPlease find enclosed a plan, obtained from the Land Registry, outlining what I believe to be the extent of your land, if this is correct please sign and return\nto me.  If the boundaries are incorrect, please outline the true extent.  It is important that the plan is accurate. If you own any additional land, please\nidentify this on the plan so that we can ensure that our understanding of your property is correct.\nNext Steps\nPlease review the enclosed flowchart explaining the equity release process and provide us with any outstanding information that we have requested to\nenable us to act swiftly once your offer is received where you have not already provided them to Equilaw such as account details for existing charges,\ndetails of any occupiers or your management company (if Leasehold) details.  On receipt of your offer a dedicated case handler will progress your offer\nthrough to completion. The offer is sent simultaneously to you and the lender\u2019s solicitors (who will then send it to us).\nWe will issue and send you a \"\nLegal Report Pack\". \nThis pack will come directly from Equilaw and is not this pack of documents, of the offer that you will\nreceive from Legal & General Home Finance directly.\nOffers are usually issued within two weeks of the property valuation. We will not be in contact with you until we receive the offer from Legal & General\nHome Finance's solicitors. We have to await this pack of documents as it contains the legal documents that you will need to sign in the presence of our\nsolicitor. On average there is a delay of approximately 3 working days between you receive the offer and us. If we have not contacted you after 3 days\n(from your receipt of the offer directly from Legal & General Home Finance) please contact me so that I may chase Legal & General Home Finance's\nsolicitors for this documentation.\nOnce we receive the offer from Legal & General Home Finance's solicitors, we will contact you to book a face to face appointment will our attending\nsolicitor. \nWe have produced a short information video demonstrating how the appointment can safely proceed \nhttps://youtu.be/e3GRm6PP4FM\n. We would urge\nyou to review the video so that you know what to expect and so that you can raise any question or queries relating to the appointment.\nWe have been successfully conducting meetings in this manner since the start of the pandemic, so you are in safe hands with Equilaw. We are: \nclosely following Public Health England and NHS guidance,  \nasking our attending solicitors to self-certify weekly that they have not (to the best of their knowledge) come into contact with any \u2018at risk\u2019\nindividuals,  \narranging for staff to self-isolate if there is any risk of exposure; \nre-arranging any appointment, if our solicitor has been exposed; \nadapting our face to face meetings\n \nto be contact free, taking less than 15 minutes; \nensuring that all staff are issued with PPE and sanitiser. \nWe believe that, by adopting these measures, we can conduct an appointment preserving the integrity of the ERC Guidelines, adhere to the Law of\nProperty Act requirements, adhere to the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code of Conduct and, importantly, keep you physically safe. \nIf you have a pre-existing health condition that places you into a high risk category for the impact of the virus please let us know.  It is a matter for you to\ndecide if you wish to proceed.\u00e2\u20ac\u00af If there are additional precautions that can be taken to minimise any risk of infection to you, please let us know.  \nIt is mandatory, under Law of Property Act 1925, for a deed to be lawfully executed that it MUST be executed in the presence of a physically\npresent independent person. Deeds cannot, under any circumstances, be executed via video call.    \nOnce we have booked the appointment, we will send to you our \n\u201cLegal Report Pack\u201d.\n  This pack contains the documents that you will need to sign in the\npresence of our solicitor and without it the appointment cannot proceed.   \nIf you have not received the pack in the estimated time frame, please contact us.\n \nCompletion\nWe will telephone you once a completion date has been set by the Lender to seek your authorisation to complete. As the action rests with Legal & General\nHome Finance\u2019s solicitors to carry out their pre-completion checks we cannot give a precise time estimate.\nOur final bill and completion statement will be sent to you following completion.  We will pay your net funds directly into your bank account by BACS in\nthree days. If you wish to obtain your funds on the same day as completion we are able to offer a premium same day service if at an additional cost of \u00a340\n+VAT.  Please notify us if you do want to upgrade to the premium payment service and we will amend our records, but please note that funds are usually\nnot received from the lenders solicitors until mid-afternoon on the day of completion, such that same day transfer to you is not always possible. There are\ncertain parts of the transaction where we must use same day bank transfer, for example, paying off an existing charge and this is beyond our control.\n \nAfter Completion\nAny original documents will be returned to you after completion.  We will store our file for 6 years, as required by our regulators, after which time the file\nwill be confidentially destroyed.\nWe can offer extended secure off site storage of your file for 30 years at a cost of \u00a325 plus VAT, if you so wish.   If you wish to take up this service, please\nlet us know before completion.\n3"}

Our registered office and trading address is 1330 Montpellier Court,\nGloucester Business Park, Gloucester, GL3 4AH. \nEquilaw Limited is registered with the Law Society of England and Wales and is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority\n(SRA) (number: 525526). Our professional rules can be accessed at www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/welcome.page.  Office hours are 9.00\nam to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday, although arrangements can sometimes be made to answer calls or schedule meetings outside these hours.\nOur Responsibilities and Service Levels\nWe aim to offer a high quality service at a fair cost.  We will agree the work we will carry out before we start and will confirm this in writing.\n We will give details of the case handler who will manage your matter within our letter of engagement, together with their direct dial\ntelephone number, their email address and details of their supervisor.  We aim to return your phone calls the same or the next working day\nand to respond to written communications within two working days. \nYour Responsibilities\nYou will provide us with clear, timely and accurate instructions and give us as much information as possible about your matter at the outset,\nso that we may fully understand what you want to achieve and by when. You will provide us with full contact details: mobile/home/work\ntelephone number(s) and email(s). You will tell us promptly if new information becomes available, or if your objectives or circumstances\nchange.  Where we act for more than one client jointly, you authorise us to act on the instructions of either or both of you.  \nOur Charges\nOur engagement letter must be read in conjunction with these terms of business. Together these set out the basis on which we will charge\nyou. This will usually include an overall estimated charge for the work you have asked us to do and a list of the money we may have to pay out\non your behalf (disbursements).  \nWhere we have provided an overall estimated charge in our engagement letter based on the maximum loan facility that we have been\nnotified of on our instruction, we have reasonably assumed that you will not substantially change the work you have asked us to do, that no\nadditional work is required by your lender as a condition of the loan, that the work concludes reasonably smoothly and in accordance with the\nscope of work agreed in the engagement letter, and that completion takes place by an agreed date.   Where we are unable to complete your\nwork within the overall cost estimate we will, if reasonably practical, notify you in advance and explain why.  We will carry on and complete\nany additional work that may be necessary to progress your matter unless you instruct us otherwise and you will remain liable for the work\ndone, which will be charged in accordance with the scale of charges in the additional fees schedule that may be found in the supplement to\nthis document, or otherwise as agreed with you.  For example, if we have provided you with a figure on the basis that the property is\nfreehold, and it transpires that the property is leasehold, we will charge an additional leasehold supplement.  In cases where we have agreed\nthat our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release application, this offer is restricted to the equity\nrelease application itself and does not apply to any additional work or disbursements, and you will remain liable for these costs.\nSolicitors\u2019 Appointments\nWhere we are arranging for an appointment with a solicitor to witness your document signing and you then cancel the appointment giving\nless than two working days\u2019 notice, or you otherwise make it necessary by your own action or inaction to schedule a further appointment, we\nwill charge you the full cost of the missed or void appointment and we may require payment in advance for any additional visit.  Note that\n\u2018working day\u2019 in this context means Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm.\nNote also that in cases where we have agreed that our own fees may be waived in the event of non-completion of your equity release\napplication this offer does not apply to any solicitors\u2019 appointments that we book for you. if your application fails to complete the cost of the\nappointments (\u00a375 plus VAT on each occasion) will be due for payment.\n \nYou must have your mortgage offer in writing and our Legal Report Pack before the appointment, if you have not received our paperwork by\n1.30pm on the day before your appointment at the very latest please contact us to cancel the appointment to avoid any charges.\nIndemnity Insurance\nOccasionally legal problems arise in property transactions, which may result in an insurance policy being necessary to protect the client\nand/or a mortgage lender/home reversion provider.  Where this is necessary you will be notified in advance and you will remain liable for the\ncost of the insurance cover required, and we also reserve the right to charge for our work in arranging your indemnity insurance as shown in\nthe additional fees schedule.\nShortfall\nIf you believe that it is likely there will be a shortfall between the outstanding financial commitments secured against your house, together\nwith the legal and financial adviser fees and the amount of equity release you are borrowing please note that we will need to undertake\nchecks in accordance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2019, and\nwe cannot accept any funds into our account until these checks have been made.  Once the funds have been approved, please note that\npayments by debit card (we can accept up to \u00a32,000) take 2 working days to clear and cheques take up to 10 working days.  Please bear in\nmind that this may delay the completion.  We will include all known legal and other advice fees, charges, disbursements and previous loan\nrepayments in our calculations, and we will only request completion of your equity release application once the full shortfall amount is\nreceived by us.  If you believe that a shortfall is likely please notify us as soon as possible.\n7"}

Where we act for more than one client jointly, liability to settle our bill rests jointly and\nseverally with all those who are party to the instruction.   We may charge interest at the prevailing County Court judgment rate on any part of\na bill which remains unpaid for more than one month after delivery.  We may also take recovery action through the Courts, in which case we\nwill add our own costs plus interest, Court fees and any additional costs we may incur for legal advice to the outstanding amount, which can\nsignificantly increase the amount owed.  \nYou agree that we are entitled to settle your bills(s) for legal work and advice arising from your equity release application and from any other\nassociated legal or other work or advice provided to you by us or by your lender, IFA or introducer from monies received or held on your\nbehalf (including monies received from your lender or others) and to retain files, documents and other property held by us until payment is\nmade.

Where we are sending funds to you, we must rely on the banking system to make the\npayment and we can accept no responsibility for any errors or delays once the funds leave our account.\nWe expressly reserve the right to raise interim statute bills, should your matter become protracted. All interim statute bills are due for\npayment on delivery.  Payment of interim statute bills and bills for matters that do not proceed to completion should be made in sterling\neither by cheque payable to Equilaw Limited, or direct to our bank account (details on request).  \nShortfalls and Completion Funds\nWe do not accept personal or building society cheques or bankers\u2019 drafts for deposits/completion funds or for shortfalls, ie. if you are\nborrowing less money than is currently owing on any existing mortgage.  We are obliged under the Anti Money Laundering Regulations (2019)\nto establish the source of any funds that are provided by you and we cannot accept any payment from you until this has been completed.  We\nare happy to accept debit card payments up to \u00a32,000 but we are unable to accept payment by credit card. in exeptional circumstances.\nPayment of \u2018Sums in lieu of Interest\u2019\nWe occasionally hold client money on deposit with NatWest Bank and with other major financial institutions, with deposits spread in order to\nhelp mitigate risk in light of the current global economic situation.  All amounts held qualify for cover under the FSA\u2019s deposit guarantee\nscheme. Due to the fact we are a Law firm and not a Bank, technically we do not pay \u201cinterest\u201d but \u201csums in lieu of interest\u201d.  However, from\nthe Inland Revenue\u2019s point of view, there is no difference and any amount received must be included on your tax return (if applicable).  Any\npayment of \u201cinterest\u201d is unlikely to be as high you could achieve personally by approaching the deposit market. \nIt is important to understand that we are specifically prohibited from acting or behaving as a Bank and it follows that we can only accept client\nmoney in support of a specific transaction.  You should not remit money to us until requested.  We will normally hold money in a general\nclient account on your behalf pending the legal transaction.  \nWe will account to you for a sum in lieu of interest if it is considered reasonable to do so and the amount exceeds \u00a335; below this amount, it is\nconsidered that the administrative costs of managing the funds would exceed any payment due.\n\u201cConsidered reasonable\u201d \u2013 the following are example of factors to be considered:\nthe nature of the transaction;\namounts held and their duration;\nthe purpose of us holding the funds.\nDue to the current state of the financial markets, any \u201cinterest\u201d paid will be at a rate of 0.1%. (This will be reviewed periodically.)  Any\n\u201cinterest\u201d paid will be gross of tax. (Net interest is no longer a facility offered by our bank.)\nRegulation and limits on our services\nWe will not carry out a physical inspection of the property and will not be able to give you any advice in relation to any valuation or survey\nreport that the equity release lender commissions.  We are not able to offer advice upon any tax implications of your transaction or on the\nsuitability of any mortgage/reversion product or other financial arrangements you have made including, but not restricted to, inheritance\nplanning arrangements, for which appropriate specialist advice should be sought.

{"classification": "Rubbish", "id": "128504", "filename": "128504/18.pdf", "page_num": 12, "text": "FAQ\n1. \nDo I have to send in my title deeds? \nIf your property is registered at the Land Registry, we will obtain up to date copies of your Title\ndirectly from them at a charge of \u00a36.  You will need to pay this charge, either on completion from your equity release funds or via your\ndirect debit authority (if your application does not complete).  \nIf your property is unregistered we will require your Title Deeds in order to proceed.  You will be asked to sign a Form of Authority\nallowing the holder of the deeds to provide them to us, if they are not in your possession.  \n2. \nI have already supplied my identification to the financial adviser.  Why do you want it as well?\n We are required, by your Lender\u2019s\nsolicitor, to guarantee your identity in accordance with the Money Laundering Regulations requirements.  To do this we must have sight\nof original government issued photographic identity evidence e.g. a valid driving licence or passport.  If you do not have this then an\nIdentify Verification Form should be completed.  We can accept a certified copy identification from your Adviser at the outset, but the\nattending solicitor will need to inspect the originals to confirm that they witnessed you signing the documentation and to allow us to\nprovide the required guarantee to the Lender\u2019s solicitor.\n3. \nI have already sent my buildings insurance to the financial adviser.  Can\u2019t they confirm the details with you?\n We have to provide\ndetails to the Lender and ensure that the cover satisfies their requirements, therefore we do require a copy but are happy for your\nfinancial advisor to forward a copy to us.  As you must have valid insurance for completion we suggest checking the expiry date as it will\ndelay your case if it expires prior to completion.\n4. \nDo I have to see a Solicitor in person when signing the Equity Release documentation?\n Yes. The solicitor\u2019s appointment is a key\nrequirement of the Equity Release Council Code of Conduct and acts as a \u2018safety net\u2019 to ensure full comprehension of the consequences\nof the Equity Release and to guarantee your identity and address.  A checklist and instructions are prepared for the solicitor, ensuring\nthat they know what is required of them at the appointment.  Please note that only the equity release applicant(s) can be present for\nthe solicitors' appointment. The solicitor is not attending for the purpose of advising you on the equity release, that is our role, please\nrefer any queries to us before your solicitor\u2019s appointment.\n5. \nHow do I book my solicitors appointment?\n Depending upon your communication preference we will either telephone you to offer an\nappointment day, or you will select a suitable day from our Booking Portal.  We will text a confirmation of the appointment day to you\nwithin 15 minutes of booking the day.  At 2.30pm on the day before the appointment we will text (to the same number) a one hour\ntime slot that our solicitor will arrive within.  If you do NOT receive the first text, or have not received the second text by 15.00hrs (day\nbefore appointment day) please contact us. Please make sure you leave a further 30 mins after the latest time for the appointment to\noccur, in the event that our solicitor arrives towards the end of the time slot.  Every endeavour is made to keep to the timings provided\nbut because our solicitors travel many miles each day visiting clients occasionally issues do occur such as adverse weather conditions,\ntraffic, accidents or other delays arising as a result of an earlier client's appointment. \n6. \nI cannot travel to Equilaw\u2019s offices for the solicitor\u2019s appointment.  What can I do? \nWe can almost always arrange for one of our\nmobile solicitors will attend your home.  In the rare occasion that we cannot arrange a home visit we will book an appointment for you\nwith a local solicitor.  You may wish to use your own solicitor, this is perfectly acceptable and we will ensure that they are sent\ninstructions prior to the appointment.\n7. \nThe solicitors appointment time is inconvenient to me.\n Please telephone us immediately to cancel and we will re-book a new day or, if\na specific appointment day/time is required we will book for you to attend a local solicitor\u2019s office.\n8. \nShould we update our Wills at the same time? \nMaking a Will is a personal decision however it is recommended that a Will is made or\nupdated following any change in circumstances, such as an equity release mortgage.  Additionally, you may wish to consider making a\nLasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in the event you may become physically or mentally incapacitated in later life, especially if you have a\ndrawdown product. \n9. \nWhy should I instruct you and not a local solicitor? \nYour local solicitor may not have dealt with (many) equity release transactions or\nproducts and this lack of experience can cause delays.  Equilaw only do Equity Release related work and as such we are experienced\nspecialists in this area of law resulting in a proactive, customer focused approach.  Please review previous client feedback on webpage,\nTwitter, LinkedIn and our Industry Awards.\n10. \nWhen will you be in touch with me? \nThere are key milestones (in a standard transaction) when we will be in touch: (1) when instructed\n(2) on receipt of your mortgage offer (3) arranging your solicitor\u2019s appointment (4) receipt of the completion date and (5) sending the\nnet balance of your Equity Release and completion statement.  If your case is non-standard we will update you as/when appropriate\nand let you know when you can expect to hear from us next.\n12"}

These fraudsters have realised\nthat millions of pounds are sent electronically around the banking system on the strength of little more than an email or phone call\ncontaining bank details and the amounts to be transferred.  They have developed sophisticated ways of diverting this money by a\ncombination of identity theft, intercepting emails, and by persuading firms and their clients to transfer large sums of money to the\nfraudsters\u2019 accounts by impersonating solicitors, banks and property owners.  Usually none of the money is ever recovered, and the\nsolicitors and clients all lose out.  The popular name for all this criminal activity is \u2018Cybercrime\u2019 and it is increasingly prevalent.\nWe take all reasonable steps to protect your information.  However, the criminals are becoming ever more sophisticated in their\napproach and we cannot guarantee that emails have not been intercepted or corrupted in transit from us to you (or vice versa).  Equally\nwe cannot accept any liability for intercepted communications, or for any loss that you may incur as a result of any such unlawful\ninterception. \nIf you have any concerns at all, or you would like to double-check the content of any email, then please use our official contact details,\npublished by the Law Society of England & Wales, and speak to a Director or someone who has been working with you.  Our Head Office\ntelephone number is 01452 657999 and you should call us on this number to verify anything suspicious, especially if you receive any\nunexpected messages relating to financial matters, the transmission of funds between us or a change in contact details here. \nLast year, approaching 2 million people were the subject of identity theft, and it has been estimated that the amounts involved\nexceeded \u00a32 billion. The City of London police stated that the average loss was \u00a3112,000.\nWe take your security very seriously and, should it be necessary, we will send you details of our client bank account so that you may send\nus any payments that may be required. This will be sent to you securely by way of a password protected document and this will establish\na payment route that, once confirmed, should be used for all further payments to us.\nWe are not planning to change our bank and we will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to any other bank\naccount without additional corroboration or security measures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third\nparty directly with the exception of paying for an office or home visit with one of our agents, or settling any outstanding mortgage\nbalances (if appropriate). When we call you on the telephone we will always ask you three security questions so that we can be sure\nwe are talking to the right person.  If you receive any suspicious telephone call or email message that claims to be from us and asks\nyou to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money to any third party, then please call us immediately using our main\noffice telephone number 01452 657999.\nWhat should you be looking out for?\nSudden urgency to send funds for no apparent reason.\nLast minute changes to bank details or lending arrangements.\nLast minute requests for more money for no clear reason.\nCallers that don\u2019t seem to know any details about the transaction.\nRequests to pay money directly to a third party who is not known to you.\nThe cost of your transaction changing, or being asked to pay a different amount than stated on the documentation sent.\nEmails containing spelling or grammar mistakes, or addressed to \u2018Dear Client\u2019.\nHow can you protect yourself?\nDon\u2019t trust \u2018call back\u2019 numbers - use numbers you trust or which can be verified independently.\nDon\u2019t click on \u2018contact us\u2019 or \u2018email us\u2019 links in emails; instead, type in a known email address or telephone us.\nCheck all amounts and bank information with us if you are suspicious and cross check that there have been no changes.\nCheck that the contact details on the email or telephone call match the information we have already supplied to you.\nWe will never ask our Accounts Department to contact you directly without us informing you first.\nAND FINALLY \u2026 IF YOU SENSE THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG IN A COMMUNICATION TO YOU FROM US THEN IT PROBABLY IS!\n17"}

The funds are, of course, yours to do with as you wish, but you should be\naware of the possible consequences:\nIn certain circumstances, such as insolvency or the eligibility for state benefits in the future, the gift may be viewed as deliberate\ndeprivation of your assets (i.e. giving money away with the intention of reducing the value of your assets) and may therefore need\nto be repaid and/or may be included in any means-tested valuation thus impacting on your ability to obtain the benefits you are\nseeking.\nShould you have insufficient funds for your future living requirements, and no further equity release drawdown is possible (for\nexample, the maximum loan to value ratio in your home has been obtained) you will not (legally) be able to seek reimbursement of\nthe gift.\nMaking a gift now may mean that there is less in your estate to leave to other relatives. You may, therefore, wish to consider\ncovering this gift within your will to avoid any future family disagreement over the status of the funds and whether (or how) they\nare to be considered when distributing your estate.\nWe have not been privy to the discussions or advice that you have received from Infinity Mortgages and it may be that you have already\naddressed the matter with them.  If, however, you have not discussed your intention to make a gift from your equity release funds, we\nrecommend that you do so.  \nI enclose a form with this letter, and I should be grateful if you could read this thoroughly and complete it as applicable. Once you have\ncompleted the form, please sign and date it, and return to me at your earliest convenience. Please be aware that I will not be able to\ncomplete your equity release until I am in receipt of a completed and signed form.\n \nPlease contact us directly in the event there is anything contained in this letter that you do not understand or if you would like to discuss\nin more detail.\nYours sincerely,\nJordan Swinburn\njordan.swinburn@equilaw.uk.com\nTo book a call with me visit callbooking.equilaw.uk.com/JordanSwinburn\n \n18"}

You are required to \r\nexplain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.  The provider \r\nwill not complete the transaction until they have received a Certificate which has been signed and completed by \r\nboth you and your client(s), whereby you confirm that you have drawn your client\u2019s(s\u2019) attention to the risks of \r\nentering into an equity release transaction and your client(s) confirms that he/they has/have been given the advice \r\nset out in the Certificate.\r\nGuidance on Independence \r\nClients must use a legal adviser who is independent of the provider\u2019s solicitor.  If you are advising a client in relation \r\nto an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent \r\nof the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013\r\n \r\n\u00b7 the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or \r\nWales); or\r\n\u00b7 the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\r\n\u00b7 the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of \r\nScotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which \r\ntake place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s \r\nRules & Guidance\r\nPayment of Fees \r\nWhilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to \r\nthis guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients \r\nto you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to \r\nyou.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not \r\nbe calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.\r\nThis also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected \r\nwith the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative \r\nor marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel \r\nmembership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of \r\nstaff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision \r\nor purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).  For the avoidance of doubt, certain \r\nmarketing payments which are not connected with payment on a case-by-case basis are permitted, subject to the \r\nregulatory obligations of the parties concerned. You must inform your client(s) in writing of the amount and \r\nfrequency of any financial arrangement, including marketing contributions, when issuing the customer case \r\ndocumentation at the outset.\r\nIf the customer chooses not to instruct their own legal adviser, the adviser or provider (as appropriate) may offer \r\nthe name of at least one local law firm which has knowledge of equity release products.  The adviser or provider \r\nmust ensure that no pressure or financial inducement is involved in directing customers to any particular law firm \r\neither by them or the intermediaries recommending their products.\r\nReceipt of Payments \r\nIf you are acting on behalf of the client you may not receive payments or other consideration from the adviser or \r\nprovider if that payment is dependent on the completion of an equity release transaction.

If  You \nare re- mortgaging the Property it must be insured from at least  two \nworking days before completion of your  Mortgage.  \n4.8.3  If You arrange insurance,  \n4.8.3.1  You must pay the insurance premiums on time;  and \n4.8.3.2  whenever We ask, you must show Us a copy of the policy  and \nproduce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and its \npremiums are paid up to date.  \nThe \"Reinstatement Value\" is the amount (including Value Added Tax)  required:  \n\u2022 to demolish and/or rebuild the Property;  \n\u2022 for site clearance of the  Property;  \n\u2022 to pay surveyors and other professional  fees;  \n\u2022 to comply with planning permissions; and  \n\u2022 to pay for alternative accommodation.  \nThat amount must be adjusted at least once a year in accordance with any \nchange in the House Rebuilding Cost Index prepared by the Royal Institute of \nChartered Surveyors or, if that index ceases to exist, such similar index as We in Our reasonable discretion decide.  \n4.8.4  You shall ensure that Our interest as mortgage lender is protected in one of the following ways, as We require in the Lifetime Mortgage Offer:  \n4.8.4.1  Insured with Us and You as co- insureds on a composite basis;  \n4.8.4.2  Insured with Us and You as joint insureds; or  \n4.8.4.3  With Our interest as mortgage lender noted on the insurance policy.  \nWe will be entitled to require You, by giving You notice, to ensure that Our interest is protected in one of the other ways if it is Our reasonable opinion that "}

Our insurance \nmay not cover Your interests or the interests of anyone else at all, or if any of Your or anyone else's interests are covered, they might only be partly covered.  \n4.8.9  You can at any time ask Us for details of any insurance We have put in place.

Where the insurance allows, We will have a right to negotiate with the insurer and settle a claim on reasonable terms.  \n4.9 Proceeds from insurance  claims  \nYou must ensure that all money payable under any insurance in respect of loss or damage to the Property, whether effected or maintained pursuant to paragraph 4.8 above or otherwise, shall be paid to Us or, if it is paid to You, You must hold all money received on trust for Us.

This means  that if You have  more than one property  \nmortgaged to Us and You want  to pay off just one of those mortgages,  We can refuse to redeem  \nthe mortgages  separately  and insist  that You pay off all of them,  before redeeming any of them.  \n6 Using Our  rights  \n6.1 Where  You need Our consent  under  these Conditions  before doing  something,  We will not \nunreasonably  withhold  or delay  that consent.  For example,  it will be reasonable for Us to refuse  \nto consent to something We reasonably think  will: \n6.1.1  make it less likely You can pay Us all Amounts Owed at any  time;  \n6.1.2  negatively affect Our Mortgage or the value of the Property;  or \n6.1.3  have any significant negative impact on Us in relation to the Mortgage.  \nWhere  You need Our consent  before doing  something,  You will need it before going  ahead and \nYou should therefore ask for consent in good time before going  ahead.  \n6.2 Where:  \n6.2.1  We have the power to require You to take or not to take certain action;   \n6.2.2  something must be to Our satisfaction or must be acceptable to  Us; or  \n6.2.3  or a document must be in Our required form,  \nthen, unless otherwise specified, We will act reasonably when exercising these rights.  For \nexample,  We will be acting  reasonably  if We act as a prudent  lender  would.  \n7 Enforcement of security \n7.1 Powers to be exercisable without  restrictions  \n7.1.1  Section 103 of the Act shall not apply  to the Mortgage.  Failure to pay the Secured  \nSums  as and when  they become  due or any other  breach  by You of the covenants  \nand conditions contained in the Mortgage or in the Loan Agreement, shall  result  in \nthe Mortgage becoming enforceable and the powers conferred upon Us by  the Act \nand the Mortgage becoming immediately exercisable without the restrictions  \ncontained in the Act as to the giving  of notice or otherwise with respect  to the whole  \nor any part of the Property. Section 103 of the Act says that We cannot use Our \npower  to sell the Property  until certain  conditions  have been  met. If We did not \ndisapply  them,  the conditions  would  mean,  for example,  that if We issued a notice  \nasking You  to make  a payment,  We would  have  to give you three months  to make  \nthe payment before exercising Our right to sell. \n7.1.2  In connection  with exercising  Our powers,  in Our discretion,  We may appoint  You \nor Your Personal Representative(s) as Our agent to market the Property on Our \nbehalf.

What is a lifetime mortgage?\r\nImportant Information From The Financial Conduct Authority:\r\n\u2022A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life,\r\nand which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or\r\na regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the\r\nsale of your home after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death\r\nof the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries.\r\n\u2022If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or\r\nyou may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay the\r\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Any money left\r\nover belongs to you.\r\n\u2022If you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the\r\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Again, any\r\nmoney left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs\r\nto move into long-term care, you don\u2019t usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either\r\ndies or moves into long-term care or another property.\r\n\u2022If you decide that you simply don\u2019t want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount\r\nyou owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do.\r\nSection 13 of this Offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage.\r\n\u2022Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment \u2013 this means you borrow a lump sum which is\r\ninvested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the full details of\r\nthe investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents\r\ntogether.\r\n4. What you have told us\r\n\u2022You want an Offer for the Capital Choice Midi Drawdown lifetime mortgage.\r\n\u2022Your details: Female 70 years\r\nMale 92 years\r\n\u2022Your property has been valued at: \u00a3525,000.00\r\n\u2022Construction: Standard\r\n\u2022You want a cash facility of \u00a3191,625.00.\r\n\u2022You want to receive an initial advance of \u00a3150,000.00. No fees have been added to this amount,\r\nbut the fees you need to pay are shown in Section 11. For details of any insurance charges, see\r\nSection 12.\r\n\u2022The remainder of your cash facility that is not drawn down at the start of your mortgage is subject to\r\na minimum draw down amount of \u00a32,000.00 each time (or the full amount of the remaining facility\r\nif less than \u00a32,000.00), and is also subject to the conditions described in Section 5. Charges may be\r\napplicable to further draw downs, as described in the Tariff of Charges.\r\n\u2022Changes to any of the information you have given us, could alter the information in this Offer. If this\r\nis the case ask for a revised Offer.\r\nCC v1.33 1121 Page 3 of 15"}

Description of this mortgage\r\nThis Offer is for a Capital Choice Midi Drawdown provided by more 2 life Limited. Your mortgage includes\r\na cash facility as discussed with your adviser. It provides you with a cash lump sum at the start of the loan\r\nand a cash facility which you may be able to draw cash from after your initial lump sum loan completion,\r\nsubject to a minimum withdrawal of \u00a32,000.00 or withdrawal of the remaining facility if less than \u00a32,000.00.\r\nThe amount of this facility is not guaranteed and we may reduce or remove this facility at any time. You\r\ncan apply direct to more 2 life Limited for further borrowing of the remaining amount of this facility without\r\nfurther financial advice. Any such further borrowing will be based on your property value and the terms\r\nand interest rates available from more 2 life Limited at the time. In particular, the interest rate applied to\r\nsuch further borrowing may be more or less than your initial interest rate. You do not have to make any\r\npayments during the life of this lifetime mortgage.\r\nCircumstances in which the cash facility may be reduced or removed include:\r\n\u2022 Where the total of all cash advances, rolled-up interest and other charges exceeds the maximum\r\nloan applicable at the time of applying to use the cash facility, based on your age and property\r\nvalue at the time.\r\n\u2022 Where you are in default under the mortgage conditions.\r\n\u2022 Where we no longer Offer new lifetime mortgages such as this one.\r\n\u2022 Where there are more than one of you and the property is owned by you as tenants in common\r\nbut one of you has died and not all appropriate documentation satisfactory to us has been provided\r\nto ensure the mortgage will secure the amount owed including the cash advance.\r\nAny such further borrowing will be subject to the interest rate available from more 2 life Limited at the time\r\nof application, which shall be based on the interest rates which would be applied by more 2 life Limited\r\nat such time to any new borrowing. This interest rate may be more or less than your initial interest rate. The\r\nOffer that we give to you at the time of any cash advance will set out the interest rate for that cash\r\nadvance.\r\nThis lifetime mortgage can only be arranged for either one or two people between the ages of 55 - 84,\r\nbased on the age of the youngest applicant, who own and live permanently in the property which is\r\nsubject to the lifetime mortgage.\r\nIf there are any other outstanding mortgages or charges at the time the loan is taken out, you will be\r\nrequired to use the lifetime mortgage to clear these loans. As part of the completion process our solicitors\r\nwill redeem them with the proceeds from the loan.\r\nInterest is charged at a fixed rate of 7.91% on the initial advance until receipt by more 2 life Limited of all\r\nmonies due. The interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly, meaning the interest rolls up\r\nwith interest being charged on that interest, paid when you repay your loan. See Section 8 for example.\r\nAny cash advances will be subject to the new interest rate payable at the time and set out in the Offer\r\nthat we give you for that cash advance, and which will then be fixed for the lifetime of the loan.\r\nWe have based this Offer on an estimated term of 18 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime\r\nmortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 18 years. If you are still living in your home at\r\nthe end of 18 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run.\r\nThe loan, accrued interest and charges that may be due, become payable out of the proceeds from the\r\nsale of your home under the following circumstances;\r\n\u2022 On your death, or (if joint borrowers) on the death of the last borrower.\r\n\u2022 If you move home and transferring this lifetime mortgage to the new property does not meet our\r\nlending conditions.\r\n\u2022If you move into residential or long-term care on the grounds of medical or other specialist advice.\r\nAny money left over would be paid to you or your beneficiaries.\r\nThe maximum amount you can borrow in one lump sum is \u00a3191,625.00. If you require additional funds you\r\nmay apply for further secured borrowing at any time subject to availability - see Section 14 for details.\r\nCC v1.33 1121 Page 4 of 15"}

The FCA require that this Offer is on an estimated term, as detailed in Section 5, but remember that the\r\nactual term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter. If you are still living in your\r\nown home at the end of this term, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run and the amount you owe\r\nwill continue to increase.\r\n2. more 2 life Limited has the right to take legal action to repossess your house in the following\r\ncircumstances:\r\n(a) the property not being sold within 12 months of your death (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the\r\ndeath of the last borrower) or your entering long-term care (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the last\r\nborrower entering long-term care) or otherwise vacating the property; (b) compulsory purchase or\r\nrequisition of all or any part of the property; (c) false information or omission in information given to more\r\n2 life Limited, including fraud or money laundering; (d) any failure to notify and co-operate with more 2\r\nlife Limited in relation to an environmental notice issued under the provisions of the Environmental\r\nProtection Act 1990 or the Water Resources Act 1991 relating to your property or a neighbouring property;\r\n(e) you use or permit the property to be used otherwise than solely as a private residence; (f) you are or\r\nbecome bankrupt or enter into a composition or other arrangement with any of your creditors or you have\r\nbeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been engaged in criminal activity; or (g) you\r\nare in default under the mortgage conditions.\r\n3. If negative equity arises, this will be dealt with under the no Negative Equity Guarantee as set out in\r\nSection 6. If your home is sold for more than the outstanding lifetime mortgage balance, which includes\r\ninterest, any unpaid charges and costs, you or your estate will receive the difference.\r\n4. If you move home and want to transfer this lifetime mortgage to the new property, you can do so if the\r\nnew property meets our lending conditions. You will have to pay a Valuation Fee, Arrangement Fee and\r\nour and your legal expenses in respect of the new property. If the new property is of a lower value, we\r\nmay ask you to repay part of the amount outstanding on the lifetime mortgage.\r\n5. If you move out of your home into long-term care or residential care your home must be sold and the\r\nlifetime mortgage repaid. Early repayment charges do not apply if this happens - they are only payable\r\nif you choose to repay your lifetime mortgage early. Section 13 of this Offer tells you when they are\r\npayable.\r\n6. If you want someone else to move into your home to live with you, for example; upon marriage/the\r\nformation of a civil partnership, or where someone acts as your carer, you must first get more 2 life Limited\r\nto agree before they move in. Otherwise this will breach the terms of your mortgage. Any persons that\r\nare currently residing at the property and are not party to the loan may have to sign a waiver in order to\r\ncontinue living in the property.\r\n7. You must keep your home in good repair. If you do not keep your home in good repair, more 2 life\r\nLimited has the right to inspect the property and get the repairs done, but they will tell you first if they\r\nintend to do this. The cost of any repairs that more 2 life Limited has to arrange will be added to the amount\r\nyou owe on this lifetime mortgage. Where such costs are not able to be reclaimed on the sale of the\r\nproperty, they may be excluded from the no Negative Equity Guarantee (see Section 6).\r\n8. Taking out this mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits, and may also affect\r\nyour tax position. Tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need\r\nfurther advice you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, the Pension Service, Benefits Agency or your\r\nlocal Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau.\r\n9. The property must currently be mortgage free, or if there is a mortgage outstanding then this must be\r\neither repaid before or at the time the lifetime mortgage begins. You can use the funds released through\r\nthe lifetime mortgage to do this, but no second or subsequent mortgages over the property will be allowed\r\nat any time.\r\n10. Once the mortgage has been set up, you will not be able to add another person to it, even if your\r\ncircumstances change.\r\n11. You have an obligation to maintain buildings insurance on the property that the loan is secured against\r\nwhich must be adequate to cover the cost of rebuilding the property for that period of cover, and note\r\nour interest on the property in the policy.\r\n12. We may be willing to lend you more in the future, but we have no obligation to do so. Any further\r\nborrowing (including drawings of your remaining cash facility) will be based on the prevailing lending\r\ncriteria. The amount of your cash facility is not guaranteed and the facility may be reduced or withdrawn\r\nat any time. Please see Section 5 for further details.\r\n13. Interest rates may go up before you draw down additional borrowing from your cash facility, and the\r\ninterest rate you receive from us in respect of any additional borrowing may reflect this.

What happens if you do not want this mortgage any more?\r\nEarly Repayment Charges\r\nYour lifetime mortgage is designed to be repaid when you (or both of you if there are 2 applicants) have\r\ndied or leave your home because you need long-term residential care. If you repay your lifetime\r\nmortgage at any time for any other reason you may have to pay a substantial early repayment charge.\r\nYou have to pay early repayment charges if you want to repay all or part of your lifetime mortgage during\r\nthe first 10 years after the start of the mortgage for reasons other than those shown below. In the first 5\r\nyears after the start of the mortgage, the early repayment charge will be 5% of the amount repaid.\r\nBetween 5 to 10 years after the start of the mortgage, the charge is 3%.\r\nThe following cash examples show the early repayment charges you would have to pay if the initial\r\nadvance loan was repaid in full. Each additional cash advance will attract its own early repayment\r\ncharge as set out in the Offer we give you for that cash advance.\r\nWhen repaid Early repayment charge\r\nas % of the sum repaidWhat you will owe at the\r\nend of the year (\u00a3)Maximum Early\r\nRepayment Charge (\u00a3)\r\nYear 1 5.00% 162,304.70 8,240.24\r\nYear 2 5.00% 175,622.00 8,906.10\r\nYear 3 5.00% 190,025.05 9,626.25\r\nYear 4 5.00% 205,613.07 10,405.65\r\nYear 5 5.00% 222,479.81 11,248.99\r\nYear 6 3.00% 240,734.56 7,347.04\r\nYear 7 3.00% 260,477.60 7,939.33\r\nYear 8 3.00% 281,844.95 8,580.35\r\nYear 9 3.00% 304,965.10 9,273.95\r\nYear 10 3.00% 329,987.87 10,024.64\r\nYear 11 0.00% 357,050.73 125.00\r\nThe maximum early repayment charge you would have to pay would be \u00a311,123.99 plus the redemption\r\nfee which is currently \u00a3125.00.\r\nIf you make partial repayments, greater than those described in Section 14 within any 12 month period,\r\nan early repayment charge will apply to the amount repaid.

If the new property is of a lower value,\r\nwe may ask you to repay part of the amount outstanding on the mortgage though no early repayment\r\ncharges would be applicable on this amount.\r\nCC v1.33 1121 Page 11 of 15"}

If the amount\r\nremaining in your cash facility is less than \u00a32,000, this must be withdrawn in full.

The amount available will depend upon the current value of your home,\r\nyour age, the condition of the property at time of application and the outstanding loan balance.\r\nAdditional funds are not guaranteed at any time during the life of the loan.\r\nThis will increase the amount of borrowing secured on your home.\r\nAdditional fees may apply which are detailed in the Tariff of Charges applicable at the time of application.\r\nOverpayments\r\nYou can make partial repayments of up to 10% of the initial loan amount within each 12 month period,\r\nstarting from the date your loan completes, without incurring an early repayment charge. If unused the\r\n10% partial repayment amount cannot be carried forward in whole or part to subsequent 12 month\r\nperiods. Any partial repayments over 10% within each 12 month period will be subject to early repayment\r\ncharges, see Section 13 for details. The minimum partial repayment amount is \u00a350.\r\nWhen you make a partial repayment we will apply this on the date the funds have cleared into our bank\r\naccount and the amount on which we charge interest will reduce.

The Report is not exhaustive and you should\r\nalso read the offer conditions in the More 2 Life literature carefully before proceeding. If there are any matters arising from either the Report, or the offer\r\nitself, please let me know immediately and I will attempt to address them on your behalf.\r\nPlease ensure that you read all of the information regarding your chosen product set out in the mortgage report and are satisfied with the contents before\r\nproceeding. Please check that your appointment details have been finalised and refer to the Document checklist which confirms the documents that you\r\nwill need to have with you when you have your appointment with your solicitor to enable us to progress your matter to completion.\r\nMay I suggest that you read the enclosed report before reading the remaining mortgage documentation as this will assist you with the relevant\r\nterminology it contains.\r\nPlease \r\nDO NOT\r\n sign or date any of the papers listed in the Document checklist of the Report.

Your offer was issued on 28/11/2022 and is valid for 40 days from that date.  In order to accept your\r\noffer, the signed mortgage documents must be with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors no later than 5 working days prior to the expiry date. As the offer expires on\r\n09/01/2023 we would need to send signed papers to More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors no later than 02/01/2023. \r\nIf this timescale is not met, More 2 Life will re-offer, at their prevailing interest rate (which may be higher).  If the mortgage re-offer is at a higher rate of\r\ninterest this will increase the amount paid over the lifetime of the loan or, if you are servicing the interest payments, these will rise and you should ensure\r\nthat this is affordable.  Please speak to your financial adviser for an illustration of the rolled up interest at the new rate.\r\nWhilst Equilaw cannot take any responsibility for the change in interest rate, and cannot guarantee a completion by the expiry date, we will work with you\r\nto bring your plan to completion in the shortest time possible.  To achieve this we would be grateful if you could be as flexible as possible regarding\r\nappointment dates/times,  and return documents to us as quickly as possible (ideally by Special Delivery or by hand where possible). \r\nOnce we have received all required documents we estimate that completion will be within 10 working days, this timescale is only an estimate and is not\r\nguaranteed. \r\nIf we need information from a third party (eg, an existing mortgage provider or landlord), we may also ask for your assistance in chasing up the\r\ninformation for speed.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Equilaw cannot be held liable if you do not meet the deadline to achieve the current rate of interest.\r\nIf we have not yet been in contact to book your solicitors appointment, we will do so shortly or, if you prefer, please contact Jordan Swinburn.\r\nWe would be grateful if you could please have photographic identification available at your solicitors appointment (driving licence and passport are the\r\nmost frequently used). If you do not have any photographic identification please contact Jordan Swinburn to discuss an alternative option as soon as\r\npossible. \r\nIf you believe you might have difficulties at our solicitors appointment, for example, you are deaf or hard of hearing, or cannot sign your name (due to\r\ninjury/illness) please contact me as soon as possible so that we can ensure our service is adapted to fit your needs.  Our solicitors appointment usually\r\ntakes up to 20 minutes but occasionally, to allow you to access our service, it may be necessary for a double length appointment to be booked.  Our\r\nattending lawyer cannot give legal advice at the appointment but can address any factual questions regarding the documentation you are required to sign.\r\n Any questions regarding the nature and content of the documentation in this pack should be discussed with me before the appointment proceeds.

Unless we hear from you to\r\nthe contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity\r\nrelease funds paid to you on completion. \r\nAdditionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the\r\nequity release.  The effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against your home.  Please ensure that you have\r\nreviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances.  If this applies in\r\nyour case, you will find details in the \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d section of this report.\r\nYou may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance\r\ntax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees.  The rules and regulations relating\r\nto gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. The equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose,\r\nwithout careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. \r\nPlease also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life.\r\n Further information and guidance is produced by Age UK and can be found at \r\nwww.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information-\r\nguides-and-factsheets/\r\n.\r\nIt is important to review and/or make a Will in the context of taking out an equity release plan.  Making a Will can achieve significant\r\nsavings in tax and costs of winding up your estate.  It also means that your assets will be distributed in accordance with your wishes and\r\nnot as provided for by the general laws of intestacy.  You should also consider making a Lasting Power of Attorney, which can safeguard\r\nyour position and ensure that your wishes are carried out in relation to the Property, health and finances in the event that you become\r\nincapable of handling these decisions personally in the future.  If you would like to discuss these matters please let me know and I will\r\nput you in touch with an appropriate specialist.\r\nYou should read this report, together with the Mortgage Deed, the Loan Agreement and the More 2 Life Mortgage Terms and Conditions\r\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Conditions\") before committing to the scheme.  \r\nIf there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact Jordan Swinburn or your financial adviser Vijay Ghudial\r\nbefore you proceed. You should not go ahead with the scheme until you are satisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy\r\nwith it.\r\nFraud Warning\r\nWe will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional corroboration or security\r\nmeasures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly. If you receive any telephone call or email\r\nmessage that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us\r\nimmediately using our main office telephone number which can be found on our letterhead. \r\n7"}

What is the Equity Release Scheme?\r\n1.1\r\nProduct Type\r\nFollowing advice from your financial adviser, Vijay Ghudial, More 2 Life Capital Choice Midi Drawdown Lifetime Mortgage,\r\nLifetime General Loan Conditions and Mortgage Conditions (2020 ED-v1) has been selected as the most suitable product for\r\nyour requirements.  This is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home.\r\n1.2\r\nAmount of Loan\r\nThe maximum amount that More 2 Life are willing to lend is \u00a3191,625.00. At the date of completion, you will receive a lump\r\nsum of \u00a3150,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). You will also have access to a\r\ncash facility of \u00a341,624.90.\r\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the Property as security for this loan.\r\nYou can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More 2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the\r\nrequest in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request.\r\n1.3\r\nCash Facility\r\nFollowing completion, you will have access to a Cash Facility of \u00a341,624.90.\r\nYou will not be charged interest on the Cash Facility until you draw funds from it.  When you do withdraw funds, More 2 Life\r\nwill charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher OR lower than the original rate in this offer of\r\n7.91%.  Please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the Cash\r\nFacility.  \r\nYou can apply at any time, to More 2 Life to borrow any amount within your Cash Facility subject to a minimum amount of\r\n\u00a32,000.00.  \r\nPlease note that the Cash Facility can be withdrawn by More 2 Life at any time following completion, as outlined in Section 5\r\nof your Mortgage Offer.  If this is likely to pose a problem for you, you should speak to your financial adviser immediately and\r\nbefore you proceed any further. \r\n1.4\r\nInterest\r\nThe interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 7.91%.  Interest is calculated daily and\r\nadded to the loan monthly. \r\nYou are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. Unpaid interest will be added to\r\nthe loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (\u201crolling up\u201d). The interest continues to roll up,\r\nat the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid.   Over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any\r\nperiodic voluntary repayments).  If house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the Property will be\r\neroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the Property. \r\nThe requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the Property has been abandoned. This will either be because you have\r\ndied, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the Property. Please note that interest continues to roll up until\r\nthe mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the Property); it will not stop just because you are no\r\nlonger living there.\r\nSection 8 of the Offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. The loan period\r\nmay be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest\r\nwhich accrues.\r\nThe Annual Percentage Rate is 8.3%.\r\n1.5\r\nInheritance Protection\r\nMore 2 Life offers inheritance protection.  This allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the Property, but\r\nultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow.  You have opted not to protect any of the equity in The Property.  \r\nPlease note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to\r\nopt for Inheritance Protection will have been lost.  If you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would\r\nlike to protect a proportion of the Property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to\r\n8"}

This means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or\r\nyour estate owe more than the value of your home, More 2 Life will not seek to recover any further amount than the\r\nproceeds of sale.  \r\nThis guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the Terms and Conditions of the plan.  For example, keeping\r\nthe Property in good repair and condition.  The guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by\r\nMore 2 Life. \r\nThe guarantee only applies when the Property is sold to repay the loan.  It will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the\r\nProperty and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your Property will reduce the\r\navailable equity for a new Property. \r\nAll of the lenders that belong to the Equity Release Council offer a \u201cno-negative equity guarantee\u201d which means that if the\r\nlevel of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any\r\nshortfall. However, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee.  This is not\r\nspecified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so I cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything).  The downside is\r\nthat if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not\r\nneed.  However, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable.  There is not\r\ncurrently an \u201cEquity Release Council approved\u201d product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which\r\nmeets Council standards, there is no alternative.  If you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your\r\nfinancial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you.\r\n1.7\r\nOnce the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of\r\nthe loan you are taking, versus the value of your Property.\r\nCompound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future).\r\n1.8\r\nMoving House\r\nIt is possible to move to a different Property, under the terms of the scheme (please see More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions)\r\nprovided that the Property you want to move to is acceptable to More 2 Life.  However, this is not guaranteed.  Examples of\r\nwhere More 2 Life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another Property might include a flat, where the lease does not\r\nhave enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the Property is of non-standard construction.\r\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to \u201cporting\u201d your mortgage to a new Property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than\r\nyour current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan.  No early repayment charges will apply in these\r\ncircumstances. If you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve More 2 Life from\r\nthe outset.  The solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors at all stages to ensure that\r\nMore 2 Life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend.  Only once More 2 Life have\r\nconfirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to\r\nexchange.  You must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new\r\nproperty without More 2 Life\u2019s consent.\r\nIf your proposed new Property is not acceptable to More 2 Life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract\r\nan early repayment charge.\r\nIf your proposed new home does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early\r\nrepayment charge will apply. Furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower\r\ndying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge.\r\nYou should always obtain More 2 Life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in\r\nthe event that this is not possible\r\n1.9\r\nSale of Part of your Property \r\nIf you are seeking to sell part of your Property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell More 2 Life and seek More 2\r\nLife\u2019s prior consent.  If the sale of part of your Property reduces the value of your Property you may be required to repay\r\nsome of the loan. \r\nNo early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances.\r\n1.10\r\nTaxation on the Loan\r\n9"}

The new occupier will\r\nbe required to sign the Lender's Occupier's Waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be\r\nresponsible for the legal fees) before they move in.\r\nIf you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan\r\nin the name of the proposed joint owners.\r\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to\r\nrepay part of the loan (without early repayment charge).\r\n3.4\r\nResidence\r\nThis must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. If you are planning to\r\nleave your Property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform More 2 Life of your intention, and seek its permission to\r\ndo so.  \r\nIt is important that you do this so that More 2 Life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance\r\nwith its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the Property and repayment of the loan, potentially\r\nincurring early redemption charges.  \r\nYou must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the Property.  Usually this is a\r\nrequirement if you are planning to leave the Property empty for 30 days or more.\r\n3.5\r\nYou can live in the Property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage\r\nconditions).  Please carefully read More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions\r\n(including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the Terms and Conditions). \r\n3.6\r\nRight to Inspect the Property\r\nMore 2 Life is entitled to inspect the Property periodically to ensure that the Terms and Conditions of the loan are being\r\ncomplied with.  More 2 Life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of\r\nemergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse.  This is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is\r\nset out at Section 10 in the Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.7\r\nRepair & Maintenance\r\nYou have agreed to keep the Property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting\r\nit fall into disrepair.\r\nIf More 2 Life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done\r\nwithin the time stipulated or More 2 Life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it.\r\n If you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage\r\nand interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up.\r\nPlease also note that if you do not keep the Property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out\r\nthe repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee.\r\n3.8\r\nInsurance\r\nYou must keep the Property fully insured, by a company approved by More 2 Life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to\r\n12"}

It is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate,\r\nincluding the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the Property to move into long term\r\ncare.

Lenders do not usually withhold consent\r\nunreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and\r\nbasements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects.\r\nIf you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as Green Deal) you must first obtain\r\nthe written permission of More 2 Life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the Property, which is not allowed by\r\nMore 2 Life).\r\n3.12\r\nAcquiring additional land adjoining the Property\r\nIf you buy or acquire any land next to the Property please notify More 2 Life.  More 2 Life may require you to extend the\r\nmortgage to cover include this piece of land.  This is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the\r\nProperty (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. Please see More\r\n2 Lifes Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.13\r\nRenting out the Property\r\nYou cannot rent out the Property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself.  If you wish to do so, please contact More 2 Life.\r\nIf More 2 Life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a \u201cBuy to Let\u201d loan.  Your financial adviser will be\r\nable to assist you.\r\n3.14\r\nBusiness Use\r\nYou cannot use your home for business purposes.

When does the loan have to be repaid? \r\n4.1\r\nThe loan contract ends when: \r\nThe last owner of the Property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or\r\nresidential nursing care according to the definition of \u201ccare\u201d in the Terms and Conditions, which you should read\r\ncarefully); or\r\nIf you purchase another Property and the loan cannot be ported; or\r\nthe Property is permanently abandoned; or\r\nIf you become bankrupt; or\r\nIf you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the Terms and Conditions.\r\nThe amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by More 2 Life (for\r\nexample repair costs). \r\nThe term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 18 years.  This does not mean the mortgage\r\ncomes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase.\r\n4.2\r\nImpact of Loan ending due to Death or Long Term Care \r\nIf the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then More 2 Life may request medical or other specialist evidence\r\nof the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused.\r\nNo early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the\r\nloan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\r\nThe term will also end on death. No early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will\r\ncontinue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\r\n4.3\r\nSale of the Property \r\nYou or your Attorney (if you have appointed one under a Power of Attorney) or Personal Representatives (if you have died)\r\nwill have a maximum of 12 months to sell the Property.  If the Property is not sold within 12 months More 2 Life may take\r\nover conduct of the sale.  This would usually be if More 2 Life perceived no progress was being made and that this was\r\nunreasonable in the circumstances.\r\nBy signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint More 2 Life under a Power of\r\nAttorney in relation to the Property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. That said, if you are still capable of\r\ndealing with your own affairs, or have your own Attorney, More 2 Life would not usually get involved. \r\nHowever, it does mean that More 2 Life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the\r\nProperty, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the Property at the\r\nend of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so.\r\n4.4\r\nBankruptcy and/or Breach of Material Contract Terms \r\nThe loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the Terms and Conditions,\r\nspecifically your obligations as set out in the Terms and Conditions. Please note that early repayment charges are applicable\r\nin these circumstances.\r\n4.5\r\nEarly Repayment Charges. \r\nEarly repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the Terms and Conditions.\r\nIt is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time.

What are the advantages?\r\n5.1\r\nYou will have an immediate lump sum of \u00a3150,000.00 to use as you wish, unless you have used the funds to clear existing\r\ndebts.\r\nYou also have a cash facility of \u00a341,624.90.\r\n5.2\r\nYou retain ownership of your home.\r\n5.3\r\nYou can \u201cport\u201d your loan to new Property, provided that the onward Property is acceptable to More 2 Life. \r\n5.4\r\nMore 2 Life does not expect repayment of this loan during your lifetime (unless/until the surviving borrower is in long term\r\ncare which brings the contract to an end) and you do not have to make payments whilst you are living at the Property.  You\r\nhave the option to repay in full, should you so wish, which will be subject to the Early Repayment calculation as set out\r\nabove.\r\n5.5\r\nSubject to you complying with the Terms and Conditions, More 2 Life offers a no-negative equity guarantee, so that you (or\r\nyour estate) will never owe more than the value of the Property, even if the level of the loan has out-stripped the value of\r\nthe remaining equity in your home.  \r\n17"}

What are the disadvantages?\r\n6.1\r\nMeans-tested State benefits, such as Pension Credit or Council Tax benefits may be affected.  You should therefore check\r\nyour entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. \r\n6.2\r\nThe loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in your home over time, where no voluntary\r\nrepayments are made, particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the\r\nvalue of your home.\r\n6.3\r\nFurther loans against the Property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by\r\nMore 2 Life while its loan is still in existence.  A further advance from More 2 Life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your\r\nindividual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in your Property.  \r\n6.4\r\nIf you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt the Property can be repossessed and the no negative equity\r\nguarantee may be revoked.\r\n6.5\r\nThis is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the Property\r\nis repossessed). For your peace of mind, More 2 Life have set a maximum figure which can be charged of \u00a311,123.99, this\r\nallows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging.\r\nThe calculation of the charges is as set out in Section 13 of the Offer.\r\n18"}

Conclusions: Risk -v- Reward\r\nIt is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the\r\nrisks of entering into this agreement.\r\nRisk\r\n7.1\r\nIf you seriously breach the Terms and Conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the Property could be repossessed and sold to\r\nrepay the loan.  This may incur early repayment charges.  If you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity\r\nguarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by More 2 Life as a result of the breaches.\r\nMore 2 Life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach.\r\nRepossession would always be a matter of last resort.\r\n7.2\r\nIf you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances.\r\nFurther additional secured borrowing from More 2 Life is not guaranteed. \r\n7.3\r\nIf you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you\r\nwished to re-mortgage with another lender.\r\n7.4\r\nIf the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump\r\nsum that you have taken. \r\n7.5\r\nIf you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of\r\nthe loan will erode the equity available in the Property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary\r\nrepayments) , particularly if the value of the Property does not go up over time.  This means that you would not be able to\r\nleave this Property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your Wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the\r\nProperty have been sold.\r\n7.6\r\nEligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. \r\n7.7\r\nAny existing charge secured against the Property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which\r\nwill reduce the amount you receive on completion.\r\n7.8\r\nIf your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt\r\nsecured against your home.  You should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the\r\nbest course of action for you.  \r\n \r\nReward:\r\n7.9\r\nYou will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use.\r\n7.10\r\nThere is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home\r\n(provided there are no breaches of the Terms and Conditions). \r\n7.11\r\nYou can potentially \u201cport\u201d this mortgage to a new Property if you want to move house.\r\n19"}

What happens next?\r\n8.1\r\nPlease read and consider this report carefully, together with the mortgage offer and the Terms and Conditions.  If you are\r\nwilling to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive to outweigh the Risks involved the next step is\r\nto arrange a signing appointment to complete the required documentation.  If you are still unsure, or we can clarify any\r\naspect for you, please do not hesitate to contact Jordan Swinburn.  \r\nYou should keep this report for future reference.\r\n8.2\r\nAppointment\r\n \r\nIn order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully.  It is a matter of law that\r\nthe deed MUST be executed in the physical presence of an independent person.  The Equity Release Council (\"ERC\")\r\nguidelines require this to be a solicitor.\r\n \r\nThe attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation and not to provide you\r\nwith any legal advice.  Legal advice is provided by us within this \u201cMortgage Report\u201d.  If you have any questions or queries\r\narising from this report, please direct these to Jordan Swinburn in advance of the appointment. \r\nIn preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed Document Checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are\r\navailable.  If any documents are missing, please contact Jordan Swinburn prior to the appointment so we can arrange for any\r\nreplacement documents to be sent to you in readiness.  If the missing documents are those in your care and control, but are\r\nunavailable, please contact Jordan Swinburn so that we can discuss how best to proceed.\r\nWe anticipate that the Solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. Please note that only the equity release\r\napplicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. The solicitor will need to verify your identity at the appointment\r\nand take copies of the documentation provided.  Please ensure you have:\r\n\u2022    Valid photographic signature identification: i.e Passport, Driving Licence, National Identity Card AND Address verification:\r\ni.e bank statement;\r\n\u2022    Utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current Council Tax Bill naming each borrower.\r\nVery occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing\r\nappointment.  To minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via Skype or Facetime.  If you are not able to access this via\r\nyour own (or a family/friends\u2019) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local\r\nsolicitor who will charge \u00a35 per document \u2018witnessing fee\u2019.   If this is required, we will notify you and provide our\r\nSkype/Facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. \r\n8.3\r\nCost of the Solicitor Appointment\r\nThe costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting.  If you cancel or fail\r\nto attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to\r\nbe met.  If you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency.  \r\n8.4\r\nIdentification\r\nWe must provide a \u201cguarantee\u201d of your identity to More 2 Life at the point of requesting completion.  To be able to give this\r\nguarantee we will need valid photographic Identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport.  If you do not have such identity\r\nverification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity.  \r\nPlease see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories.  Please contact\r\nJordan Swinburn to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required\r\nguarantee.\r\nAdditionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly.  \r\nIf there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your\r\nbirth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). \r\nIf there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: Your most recent council tax invoice\r\nAND a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a DWP pensions letter.\r\nIf you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or discrepancy to resolve\r\nplease let Jordan Swinburn in advance of the signing appointment, so that we can instruct your attending solicitor to obtain\r\nall necessary documentation.\r\n20"}

This timescale\r\nis only an estimate and is not guaranteed.  As such, we strongly recommend that you do not commit funds until we confirm\r\ncompletion is taking place, which we will do by telephone in advance.\r\nIf your case has any additional elements we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, because we are often\r\nwaiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and impossible to guarantee.

You must sign the Legal Charge in front of a Solicitor, Chartered Legal\r\nExecutive, Licensed Conveyancer or Barrister (who should have a current practising certificate and professional indemnity insurance).  For\r\nconvenience, all will be referred to as \u201cSolicitor\u201d for the purposes of this statement.\r\nWe Susan Mary McVay and Ray McVay\r\nOf 23 Park Lane, Colney Heath, St Albans, AL4 0NR\r\nMAKE THIS STATEMENT OF TRUTH as follows:-\r\n1. \r\nWe confirm we instructed Equilaw (\"my solicitor\") to act on our behalf in this matter and that we were told by Infinity Mortgages\r\nthat we were free to instruct a solicitor of our choice.\r\n2. \r\nWe are fully satisfied that our solicitor has properly advised us on the nature effects and implications of our entering into the\r\nEquity Release plan.\r\n3. \r\nWe have read a copy of our solicitors Equity Release report dated 02/12/2022 and we are satisfied with the contents therein and\r\nfully understand the same. \r\n4. \r\nWe are not suffering from any physical or mental condition that prevents me/us from understanding the advice I/we have had or\r\nwill receive from my/our solicitor (\u201cEquilaw\u201d) or which precludes me/us from entering into the equity release contract. \r\n5. \r\nWe are aware of the implications should we decide to participate in the \u201cHomes for Ukraine scheme\u201d and that we MUST inform\r\nour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If we fail to do so, we\r\nwill immediately breach the terms and conditions of our mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to\r\nremediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with us, they can pursue us for that\r\nloss.\r\n6. \r\nThe interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the\r\nloan could wipe out the whole of the value of our Property in due course. This means that we would not be able to leave our\r\nProperty or any part of it to beneficiaries under our Will.\r\n7. \r\nWe are not under any undue influence or external pressure from any other party (including our family members) to proceed with\r\nthis equity release contract. \r\n8. \r\nWe have been advised to seek independent expert legal and financial advice in relation to any gift or loan of money which we will\r\nmake from the equity release contract. \r\n9. \r\nWe are aware that the Equity Release plan is intended to run for the rest of our lives or until the last owner occupier has passed\r\naway or gone into permanent residential care. Early repayment charges are usually repayable should we decide to repay the loan\r\nearly or if we decide to sell the property and live elsewhere. The maximum charge payable in this case is \u00a311123.99 as set out in\r\nsection 13 of the mortgage offer. Accessing any further draw down will result in a higher charge being payable.\r\n10. \r\nWe have been advised to discuss the equity release contract with my family and other beneficiaries and am aware that taking out\r\nthe equity release plan will reduce the value of the assets we may wish to leave to others.\r\n11. \r\nWe confirm that we have been advised that Equilaw must notify the Lender of any material change in circumstances that may\r\nprevent the Equity Release from completing (for example (but not limited to) something affecting the applicant(s) such as\r\ndeterioration in health, or something affecting the property such as boundary dispute).\r\nWe are aware that Equilaw must be notified as soon as reasonably possible should our circumstances change.\r\n12. \r\nWe are aware that the lender does have the right after we or the last owner occupier dies or moves into permanent residential\r\n22"}

Equilaw cannot give you any financial advice regarding the plan\u2019s suitability for your circumstances and\r\nrequirements, now or in the future.  If you are not absolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your\r\nfinancial adviser before proceeding further.\r\nIf you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you have sought further financial\r\nadvice, from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment may not exceed the interest charged on this product.  \r\nAny existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the Property must be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release.  If you do\r\nnot intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding further.  Unless we hear from you to\r\nthe contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity\r\nrelease funds paid to you on completion. \r\nAdditionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the\r\nequity release.  The effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against your home.  Please ensure that you have\r\nreviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances.  If this applies in\r\nyour case, you will find details in the \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d section of this report.\r\nYou may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance\r\ntax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees.  The rules and regulations relating\r\nto gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. The equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose,\r\nwithout careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. \r\nPlease also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life.\r\n Further information and guidance is produced by Age UK and can be found at \r\nwww.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information-\r\nguides-and-factsheets/\r\n.\r\nIt is important to review and/or make a Will in the context of taking out an equity release plan.  Making a Will can achieve significant\r\nsavings in tax and costs of winding up your estate.  It also means that your assets will be distributed in accordance with your wishes and\r\nnot as provided for by the general laws of intestacy.  You should also consider making a Lasting Power of Attorney, which can safeguard\r\nyour position and ensure that your wishes are carried out in relation to the Property, health and finances in the event that you become\r\nincapable of handling these decisions personally in the future.  If you would like to discuss these matters please let me know and I will\r\nput you in touch with an appropriate specialist.\r\nYou should read this report, together with the Mortgage Deed, the Loan Agreement and the More 2 Life Mortgage Terms and Conditions\r\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Conditions\") before committing to the scheme.  \r\nIf there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact Jordan Swinburn or your financial adviser Vijay Ghudial\r\nbefore you proceed. You should not go ahead with the scheme until you are satisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy\r\nwith it.\r\nFraud Warning\r\nWe will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional corroboration or security\r\nmeasures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly. If you receive any telephone call or email\r\nmessage that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us\r\nimmediately using our main office telephone number which can be found on our letterhead.

What is the Equity Release Scheme?\r\n1.1\r\nProduct Type\r\nFollowing advice from your financial adviser, Vijay Ghudial, More 2 Life Capital Choice Midi Drawdown Lifetime Mortgage,\r\nLifetime General Loan Conditions and Mortgage Conditions (2020 ED-v1) has been selected as the most suitable product for\r\nyour requirements.  This is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home.\r\n1.2\r\nAmount of Loan\r\nThe maximum amount that More 2 Life are willing to lend is \u00a3191,625.00. At the date of completion, you will receive a lump\r\nsum of \u00a3150,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). You will also have access to a\r\ncash facility of \u00a341,624.90.\r\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the Property as security for this loan.\r\nYou can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More 2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the\r\nrequest in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request.\r\n1.3\r\nCash Facility\r\nFollowing completion, you will have access to a Cash Facility of \u00a341,624.90.\r\nYou will not be charged interest on the Cash Facility until you draw funds from it.  When you do withdraw funds, More 2 Life\r\nwill charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher OR lower than the original rate in this offer of\r\n7.91%.  Please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the Cash\r\nFacility.  \r\nYou can apply at any time, to More 2 Life to borrow any amount within your Cash Facility subject to a minimum amount of\r\n\u00a32,000.00.  \r\nPlease note that the Cash Facility can be withdrawn by More 2 Life at any time following completion, as outlined in Section 5\r\nof your Mortgage Offer.  If this is likely to pose a problem for you, you should speak to your financial adviser immediately and\r\nbefore you proceed any further. \r\n1.4\r\nInterest\r\nThe interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 7.91%.  Interest is calculated daily and\r\nadded to the loan monthly. \r\nYou are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. Unpaid interest will be added to\r\nthe loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (\u201crolling up\u201d). The interest continues to roll up,\r\nat the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid.   Over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any\r\nperiodic voluntary repayments).  If house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the Property will be\r\neroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the Property. \r\nThe requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the Property has been abandoned. This will either be because you have\r\ndied, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the Property. Please note that interest continues to roll up until\r\nthe mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the Property); it will not stop just because you are no\r\nlonger living there.\r\nSection 8 of the Offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period. The loan period\r\nmay be longer or shorter than is illustrated in the estimate, which will have a corresponding effect to the level of interest\r\nwhich accrues.\r\nThe Annual Percentage Rate is 8.3%.\r\n1.5\r\nInheritance Protection\r\nMore 2 Life offers inheritance protection.  This allows you to protect a percentage of the equity in the Property, but\r\nultimately affects the total amount that you can borrow.  You have opted not to protect any of the equity in The Property.  \r\nPlease note that once completion of your loan has occurred you will not be able to change your mind and the opportunity to\r\nopt for Inheritance Protection will have been lost.  If you have not explored this option with your financial adviser, or would\r\nlike to protect a proportion of the Property's value, please contact your financial adviser to discuss before proceeding to"}

This means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or\r\nyour estate owe more than the value of your home, More 2 Life will not seek to recover any further amount than the\r\nproceeds of sale.  \r\nThis guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the Terms and Conditions of the plan.  For example, keeping\r\nthe Property in good repair and condition.  The guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by\r\nMore 2 Life. \r\nThe guarantee only applies when the Property is sold to repay the loan.  It will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the\r\nProperty and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your Property will reduce the\r\navailable equity for a new Property. \r\nAll of the lenders that belong to the Equity Release Council offer a \u201cno-negative equity guarantee\u201d which means that if the\r\nlevel of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any\r\nshortfall. However, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee.  This is not\r\nspecified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so I cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything).  The downside is\r\nthat if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not\r\nneed.  However, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable.  There is not\r\ncurrently an \u201cEquity Release Council approved\u201d product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which\r\nmeets Council standards, there is no alternative.  If you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your\r\nfinancial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you.\r\n1.7\r\nOnce the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of\r\nthe loan you are taking, versus the value of your Property.\r\nCompound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future).\r\n1.8\r\nMoving House\r\nIt is possible to move to a different Property, under the terms of the scheme (please see More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions)\r\nprovided that the Property you want to move to is acceptable to More 2 Life.  However, this is not guaranteed.  Examples of\r\nwhere More 2 Life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another Property might include a flat, where the lease does not\r\nhave enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the Property is of non-standard construction.\r\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to \u201cporting\u201d your mortgage to a new Property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than\r\nyour current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan.  No early repayment charges will apply in these\r\ncircumstances. If you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve More 2 Life from\r\nthe outset.  The solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors at all stages to ensure that\r\nMore 2 Life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend.  Only once More 2 Life have\r\nconfirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to\r\nexchange.  You must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new\r\nproperty without More 2 Life\u2019s consent.\r\nIf your proposed new Property is not acceptable to More 2 Life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract\r\nan early repayment charge.\r\nIf your proposed new home does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early\r\nrepayment charge will apply. Furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower\r\ndying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge.\r\nYou should always obtain More 2 Life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in\r\nthe event that this is not possible\r\n1.9\r\nSale of Part of your Property \r\nIf you are seeking to sell part of your Property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell More 2 Life and seek More 2\r\nLife\u2019s prior consent.  If the sale of part of your Property reduces the value of your Property you may be required to repay\r\nsome of the loan. \r\nNo early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances.\r\n1.10\r\nTaxation on the Loan"}

Your obligations and what you have agreed to do \r\n3.1\r\nBorrowing\r\nYou have agreed to pay all secured debts (e.g. Any existing mortgage you may have) out of the equity release funds and\r\ncannot use your home as security for any further borrowing, unless More 2 Life gives its written permission.\r\n3.2\r\nWho can live in the Property?\r\nOnly the people named in the mortgage offer are allowed to live at the Property. \r\n3.3\r\nMoving a new person into the Property\r\nIf you want somebody else to move into your home, you must seek More 2 Life\u2019s authority to do so.  The new occupier will\r\nbe required to sign the Lender's Occupier's Waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be\r\nresponsible for the legal fees) before they move in.\r\nIf you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan\r\nin the name of the proposed joint owners.\r\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to\r\nrepay part of the loan (without early repayment charge).\r\n3.4\r\nResidence\r\nThis must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. If you are planning to\r\nleave your Property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform More 2 Life of your intention, and seek its permission to\r\ndo so.  \r\nIt is important that you do this so that More 2 Life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance\r\nwith its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the Property and repayment of the loan, potentially\r\nincurring early redemption charges.  \r\nYou must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the Property.  Usually this is a\r\nrequirement if you are planning to leave the Property empty for 30 days or more.\r\n3.5\r\nYou can live in the Property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage\r\nconditions).  Please carefully read More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions\r\n(including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the Terms and Conditions). \r\n3.6\r\nRight to Inspect the Property\r\nMore 2 Life is entitled to inspect the Property periodically to ensure that the Terms and Conditions of the loan are being\r\ncomplied with.  More 2 Life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of\r\nemergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse.  This is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is\r\nset out at Section 10 in the Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.7\r\nRepair & Maintenance\r\nYou have agreed to keep the Property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting\r\nit fall into disrepair.\r\nIf More 2 Life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done\r\nwithin the time stipulated or More 2 Life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it.\r\n If you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage\r\nand interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up.\r\nPlease also note that if you do not keep the Property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out\r\nthe repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee.\r\n3.8\r\nInsurance\r\nYou must keep the Property fully insured, by a company approved by More 2 Life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to"}

The reinstatement sum insured as assessed by More 2 Lifes valuer\r\nand must be no less than \u00a3260,000.00.\r\nWe will require sight of the new insurance policy prior to completion, to enable us to demonstrate that it meets More 2 Life\u2019s\r\nrequirements.\r\nMore 2 Life should be noted on your buildings insurance as per the Terms and Conditions and you may need to send More 2\r\nLife a copy of your buildings insurance each year, so that they can check that you have the necessary insurance cover.  If the\r\nlevel of cover is not unlimited, you should ensure it is index-linked to ensure it keeps pace with inflation every year. A copy\r\nwill be required for completion, please send to us, if not already done so.\r\nIf you do not insure your Property More 2 Life will do this for you but will re-charge you for the cost of the insurance to you.\r\nYou must pay these sums once notified, should you fail to do so More 2 Life will charge interest on the amount outstanding.\r\n These costs will fall outside of the no negative equity guarantee. You should also note that any insurance arranged by More\r\n2 Life will be suitable for More 2 Life\u2019s purposes but many not be suitable for you.  We recommend that you always source\r\nyour own index linked insurance.\r\nIf an insurable event e.g. a fire, occurs you must immediately inform More 2 Life.  Any monies paid under the insurance\r\npolicy to you must be used to repair and make good the loss and damage or repay the total debt owing.\r\n3.9\r\nImpact on your Estate\r\nYou should discuss the loan and its consequences with your heirs and beneficiaries as it will reduce the value of your estate\r\nwhich you are able to leave to them on your death. It is also likely that they will deal with the administration of your estate,\r\nincluding the repayment of this loan, once you have passed away or if you have left the Property to move into long term\r\ncare.  They will need to notify More 2 Life of this event and be aware of More 2 Life\u2019s requirements regarding repayment of\r\nthe loan.\r\n3.10\r\nLegal Notice, Orders or Proposals effecting your Property.\r\nYou must inform More 2 Life if you receive any notice, order or proposal relating to the Property.\r\n3.11\r\nAlterations to the Property\r\nYou must seek More 2 Life\u2019s permission before making any structural alterations/extensions to the Property (e.g., new\r\nbasement/orangery/conservatory and usually anything that would require planning consent and/or building regulations\r\napproval)  This is an additional requirement and we strongly recommend that you do not spend money on applying for\r\nplanning consent or building regulations approval until such time as you have obtained consent from More 2 Life in principle\r\nas, if the lender refuses, you will be unable to proceed with your planned work.  Lenders do not usually withhold consent\r\nunreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and\r\nbasements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects.\r\nIf you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as Green Deal) you must first obtain\r\nthe written permission of More 2 Life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the Property, which is not allowed by\r\nMore 2 Life).\r\n3.12\r\nAcquiring additional land adjoining the Property\r\nIf you buy or acquire any land next to the Property please notify More 2 Life.  More 2 Life may require you to extend the\r\nmortgage to cover include this piece of land.  This is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the\r\nProperty (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. Please see More\r\n2 Lifes Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.13\r\nRenting out the Property\r\nYou cannot rent out the Property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself.  If you wish to do so, please contact More 2 Life.\r\nIf More 2 Life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a \u201cBuy to Let\u201d loan.  Your financial adviser will be\r\nable to assist you.\r\n3.14\r\nBusiness Use\r\nYou cannot use your home for business purposes.  If you wish to do so you must contact More 2 Life to seek its permission."}

When does the loan have to be repaid? \r\n4.1\r\nThe loan contract ends when: \r\nThe last owner of the Property dies, goes into long term care (which may be either sheltered accommodation or\r\nresidential nursing care according to the definition of \u201ccare\u201d in the Terms and Conditions, which you should read\r\ncarefully); or\r\nIf you purchase another Property and the loan cannot be ported; or\r\nthe Property is permanently abandoned; or\r\nIf you become bankrupt; or\r\nIf you default upon any of the terms of the mortgage as set out in the Terms and Conditions.\r\nThe amount repaid will include the capital borrowed plus all rolled-up interest and any costs incurred by More 2 Life (for\r\nexample repair costs). \r\nThe term of mortgage, for illustration purposes at section 14 of your offer is 18 years.  This does not mean the mortgage\r\ncomes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase.\r\n4.2\r\nImpact of Loan ending due to Death or Long Term Care \r\nIf the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then More 2 Life may request medical or other specialist evidence\r\nof the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused.\r\nNo early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the\r\nloan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\r\nThe term will also end on death. No early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will\r\ncontinue to roll up until such time as the loan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\r\n4.3\r\nSale of the Property \r\nYou or your Attorney (if you have appointed one under a Power of Attorney) or Personal Representatives (if you have died)\r\nwill have a maximum of 12 months to sell the Property.  If the Property is not sold within 12 months More 2 Life may take\r\nover conduct of the sale.  This would usually be if More 2 Life perceived no progress was being made and that this was\r\nunreasonable in the circumstances.\r\nBy signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint More 2 Life under a Power of\r\nAttorney in relation to the Property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. That said, if you are still capable of\r\ndealing with your own affairs, or have your own Attorney, More 2 Life would not usually get involved. \r\nHowever, it does mean that More 2 Life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the\r\nProperty, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the Property at the\r\nend of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so.\r\n4.4\r\nBankruptcy and/or Breach of Material Contract Terms \r\nThe loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the Terms and Conditions,\r\nspecifically your obligations as set out in the Terms and Conditions. Please note that early repayment charges are applicable\r\nin these circumstances.\r\n4.5\r\nEarly Repayment Charges. \r\nEarly repayment charges will potentially be incurred if you are in default as set out in the Terms and Conditions.\r\nIt is possible to repay all of the outstanding loan at any time.

You should therefore check\r\nyour entitlement to any such benefits (or the effect to existing benefits) before proceeding with this loan. \r\n6.2\r\nThe loan together with the rolled-up interest could eliminate all equity in your home over time, where no voluntary\r\nrepayments are made, particularly if house prices do not rise and you have borrowed a high level of loan compared to the\r\nvalue of your home.\r\n6.3\r\nFurther loans against the Property are not guaranteed and it is unlikely that any other secured loans will be permitted by\r\nMore 2 Life while its loan is still in existence.  A further advance from More 2 Life (or a re-mortgage) would depend on your\r\nindividual circumstances (e.g. your age) and the remaining equity in your Property.  \r\n6.4\r\nIf you breach the terms of the loan or become bankrupt the Property can be repossessed and the no negative equity\r\nguarantee may be revoked.\r\n6.5\r\nThis is a long-term contract and early repayment penalties apply should you wish to redeem the loan early (or if the Property\r\nis repossessed). For your peace of mind, More 2 Life have set a maximum figure which can be charged of \u00a311,123.99, this\r\nallows you to conduct a cost versus benefit assessment of repaying/re-mortgaging.\r\nThe calculation of the charges is as set out in Section 13 of the Offer."}

Conclusions: Risk -v- Reward\r\nIt is important that you understand both the risk and the reward of the equity release loan and ensure that the rewards outweigh the\r\nrisks of entering into this agreement.\r\nRisk\r\n7.1\r\nIf you seriously breach the Terms and Conditions, or are declared bankrupt, the Property could be repossessed and sold to\r\nrepay the loan.  This may incur early repayment charges.  If you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity\r\nguarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by More 2 Life as a result of the breaches.\r\nMore 2 Life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach.\r\nRepossession would always be a matter of last resort.\r\n7.2\r\nIf you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances.\r\nFurther additional secured borrowing from More 2 Life is not guaranteed. \r\n7.3\r\nIf you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you\r\nwished to re-mortgage with another lender.\r\n7.4\r\nIf the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump\r\nsum that you have taken. \r\n7.5\r\nIf you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of\r\nthe loan will erode the equity available in the Property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary\r\nrepayments) , particularly if the value of the Property does not go up over time.  This means that you would not be able to\r\nleave this Property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your Wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the\r\nProperty have been sold.\r\n7.6\r\nEligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. \r\n7.7\r\nAny existing charge secured against the Property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which\r\nwill reduce the amount you receive on completion.\r\n7.8\r\nIf your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt\r\nsecured against your home.  You should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the\r\nbest course of action for you.  \r\n \r\nReward:\r\n7.9\r\nYou will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use.\r\n7.10\r\nThere is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home\r\n(provided there are no breaches of the Terms and Conditions). \r\n7.11\r\nYou can potentially \u201cport\u201d this mortgage to a new Property if you want to move house."}

What happens next?\r\n8.1\r\nPlease read and consider this report carefully, together with the mortgage offer and the Terms and Conditions.  If you are\r\nwilling to accept the offer and the identified rewards are sufficiently attractive to outweigh the Risks involved the next step is\r\nto arrange a signing appointment to complete the required documentation.  If you are still unsure, or we can clarify any\r\naspect for you, please do not hesitate to contact Jordan Swinburn.  \r\nYou should keep this report for future reference.\r\n8.2\r\nAppointment\r\n \r\nIn order to be able to complete your equity release the documentation must be executed lawfully.  It is a matter of law that\r\nthe deed MUST be executed in the physical presence of an independent person.  The Equity Release Council (\"ERC\")\r\nguidelines require this to be a solicitor.\r\n \r\nThe attending solicitor is there for the purpose of witnessing your signature(s) on the documentation and not to provide you\r\nwith any legal advice.  Legal advice is provided by us within this \u201cMortgage Report\u201d.  If you have any questions or queries\r\narising from this report, please direct these to Jordan Swinburn in advance of the appointment. \r\nIn preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed Document Checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are\r\navailable.  If any documents are missing, please contact Jordan Swinburn prior to the appointment so we can arrange for any\r\nreplacement documents to be sent to you in readiness.  If the missing documents are those in your care and control, but are\r\nunavailable, please contact Jordan Swinburn so that we can discuss how best to proceed.\r\nWe anticipate that the Solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. Please note that only the equity release\r\napplicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. The solicitor will need to verify your identity at the appointment\r\nand take copies of the documentation provided.  Please ensure you have:\r\n\u2022    Valid photographic signature identification: i.e Passport, Driving Licence, National Identity Card AND Address verification:\r\ni.e bank statement;\r\n\u2022    Utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current Council Tax Bill naming each borrower.\r\nVery occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing\r\nappointment.  To minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via Skype or Facetime.  If you are not able to access this via\r\nyour own (or a family/friends\u2019) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local\r\nsolicitor who will charge \u00a35 per document \u2018witnessing fee\u2019.   If this is required, we will notify you and provide our\r\nSkype/Facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. \r\n8.3\r\nCost of the Solicitor Appointment\r\nThe costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting.  If you cancel or fail\r\nto attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to\r\nbe met.  If you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency.  \r\n8.4\r\nIdentification\r\nWe must provide a \u201cguarantee\u201d of your identity to More 2 Life at the point of requesting completion.  To be able to give this\r\nguarantee we will need valid photographic Identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport.  If you do not have such identity\r\nverification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity.  \r\nPlease see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories.  Please contact\r\nJordan Swinburn to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required\r\nguarantee.\r\nAdditionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly.  \r\nIf there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your\r\nbirth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). \r\nIf there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: Your most recent council tax invoice\r\nAND a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a DWP pensions letter.\r\nIf you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or discrepancy to resolve\r\nplease let Jordan Swinburn in advance of the signing appointment, so that we can instruct your attending solicitor to obtain\r\nall necessary documentation."}

We can only forward these documents when all required conditions\r\nhave been satisfied and all documentation received. \r\nPlease ensure the Document Checklist has been fully completed.\r\nOn a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent\r\ncorrespondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately 15 working days from this point.   This timescale\r\nis only an estimate and is not guaranteed.  As such, we strongly recommend that you do not commit funds until we confirm\r\ncompletion is taking place, which we will do by telephone in advance.\r\nIf your case has any additional elements we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, because we are often\r\nwaiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and impossible to guarantee.  Jordan Swinburn will\r\nkeep you up to date with progress on your case.\r\nOn a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent\r\ncorrespondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately three to four weeks from this point. \r\nWe will endeavour to secure the earliest possible completion date (if that is what you would like) but if there is any particular\r\nurgency attaching to your case, or significance around a date (including a need to delay) please inform Jordan Swinburn so\r\nthat we can do our best to achieve your expectations.\r\n8.6\r\nCompletion arrangements\r\n \r\nMore 2 Life\u2019s solicitors Enact will contact us with a completion date once final checks have been carried out by the team\r\nthere.  We will telephone you to go through the final completion figures and to give you a final opportunity to change your\r\nmind.  \r\nPlease contact Jordan Swinburn if you are likely to be unavailable to discuss your case by telephone, at any time during the\r\nnext four weeks (on standard cases).  If we cannot reach you, we will delay completion until such time as we can speak to\r\nyou.  \r\nIf this is likely to cause you a problem, or if you have any queries about this, please let us know as soon as possible.\r\n8.7\r\nReceipt of Funds\r\nOn completion day More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors will send your funds to us.  Sometimes funds are not received until late afternoon\r\nand, in such circumstances, we may not be able to process the funds within banking hours.  We will always process your\r\nfunds on the next working day when we receive funds too late to process on the same day.\r\n  \r\nPlease contact Jordan Swinburn if you have not received your cheque within 4 working days after completion.\r\n \r\nPlease ensure that you have read and understand all sections of your mortgage report and mortgage offer. If you have any queries\r\nregarding any aspects of your equity release please do not hesitate to contact your case handler Jordan Swinburn. We will not proceed\r\nto completion with the equity release until you are happy with all of the Terms and Conditions outlined above. "}

If we fail to do so, we\r\nwill immediately breach the terms and conditions of our mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to\r\nremediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with us, they can pursue us for that\r\nloss.\r\n6. \r\nThe interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the\r\nloan could wipe out the whole of the value of our Property in due course. This means that we would not be able to leave our\r\nProperty or any part of it to beneficiaries under our Will.\r\n7. \r\nWe are not under any undue influence or external pressure from any other party (including our family members) to proceed with\r\nthis equity release contract. \r\n8. \r\nWe have been advised to seek independent expert legal and financial advice in relation to any gift or loan of money which we will\r\nmake from the equity release contract. \r\n9. \r\nWe are aware that the Equity Release plan is intended to run for the rest of our lives or until the last owner occupier has passed\r\naway or gone into permanent residential care. Early repayment charges are usually repayable should we decide to repay the loan\r\nearly or if we decide to sell the property and live elsewhere. The maximum charge payable in this case is \u00a311123.99 as set out in\r\nsection 13 of the mortgage offer. Accessing any further draw down will result in a higher charge being payable.\r\n10. \r\nWe have been advised to discuss the equity release contract with my family and other beneficiaries and am aware that taking out\r\nthe equity release plan will reduce the value of the assets we may wish to leave to others.\r\n11. \r\nWe confirm that we have been advised that Equilaw must notify the Lender of any material change in circumstances that may\r\nprevent the Equity Release from completing (for example (but not limited to) something affecting the applicant(s) such as\r\ndeterioration in health, or something affecting the property such as boundary dispute).\r\nWe are aware that Equilaw must be notified as soon as reasonably possible should our circumstances change.\r\n12. \r\nWe are aware that the lender does have the right after we or the last owner occupier dies or moves into permanent residential"}

If the mortgage re-offer is at a higher rate of\r\ninterest this will increase the amount paid over the lifetime of the loan or, if you are servicing the interest payments, these will rise and you should ensure\r\nthat this is affordable.  Please speak to your financial adviser for an illustration of the rolled up interest at the new rate.\r\nWhilst Equilaw cannot take any responsibility for the change in interest rate, and cannot guarantee a completion by the expiry date, we will work with you\r\nto bring your plan to completion in the shortest time possible.  To achieve this we would be grateful if you could be as flexible as possible regarding\r\nappointment dates/times,  and return documents to us as quickly as possible (ideally by Special Delivery or by hand where possible). \r\nOnce we have received all required documents we estimate that completion will be within 10 working days, this timescale is only an estimate and is not\r\nguaranteed. \r\nIf we need information from a third party (eg, an existing mortgage provider or landlord), we may also ask for your assistance in chasing up the\r\ninformation for speed.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Equilaw cannot be held liable if you do not meet the deadline to achieve the current rate of interest.\r\nIf we have not yet been in contact to book your solicitors appointment, we will do so shortly or, if you prefer, please contact Jordan Swinburn.\r\nWe would be grateful if you could please have photographic identification available at your solicitors appointment (driving licence and passport are the\r\nmost frequently used). If you do not have any photographic identification please contact Jordan Swinburn to discuss an alternative option as soon as\r\npossible. \r\nIf you believe you might have difficulties at our solicitors appointment, for example, you are deaf or hard of hearing, or cannot sign your name (due to\r\ninjury/illness) please contact me as soon as possible so that we can ensure our service is adapted to fit your needs.  Our solicitors appointment usually\r\ntakes up to 20 minutes but occasionally, to allow you to access our service, it may be necessary for a double length appointment to be booked.  Our\r\nattending lawyer cannot give legal advice at the appointment but can address any factual questions regarding the documentation you are required to sign.\r\n Any questions regarding the nature and content of the documentation in this pack should be discussed with me before the appointment proceeds.  If you\r\nare not ready to proceed with your appointment, as you have further questions, please cancel the appointment in good time to avoid any cancellation\r\nfees.  An appointment can be booked as soon as you are happy that you fully understand the legal advice provided by me.\r\nI look forward to hearing from you shortly and if you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me.\r\nIf you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact your case handler Jordan Swinburn.\r\nYours sincerely\r\n \r\nKarla Mutlow\r\nChartered Legal Executive\r\nFor and on Behalf of Equilaw Ltd"}

What is a lifetime mortgage?\r\nImportant Information From The Financial Conduct Authority:\r\n\u2022A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life,\r\nand which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or\r\na regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the\r\nsale of your home after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death\r\nof the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries.\r\n\u2022If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or\r\nyou may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay the\r\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Any money left\r\nover belongs to you.\r\n\u2022If you move into sheltered accommodation or long-term care you will usually have to repay the\r\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home. Again, any\r\nmoney left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs\r\nto move into long-term care, you don\u2019t usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either\r\ndies or moves into long-term care or another property.\r\n\u2022If you decide that you simply don\u2019t want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount\r\nyou owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do.\r\nSection 13 of this Offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage.\r\n\u2022Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment \u2013 this means you borrow a lump sum which is\r\ninvested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the full details of\r\nthe investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents\r\ntogether.\r\n4. What you have told us\r\n\u2022You want an Offer for the Capital Choice Midi Drawdown lifetime mortgage.\r\n\u2022Your details: Female 70 years\r\nMale 92 years\r\n\u2022Your property has been valued at: \u00a3525,000.00\r\n\u2022Construction: Standard\r\n\u2022You want a cash facility of \u00a3191,625.00.\r\n\u2022You want to receive an initial advance of \u00a3150,000.00. No fees have been added to this amount,\r\nbut the fees you need to pay are shown in Section 11. For details of any insurance charges, see\r\nSection 12.\r\n\u2022The remainder of your cash facility that is not drawn down at the start of your mortgage is subject to\r\na minimum draw down amount of \u00a32,000.00 each time (or the full amount of the remaining facility\r\nif less than \u00a32,000.00), and is also subject to the conditions described in Section 5. Charges may be\r\napplicable to further draw downs, as described in the Tariff of Charges.\r\n\u2022Changes to any of the information you have given us, could alter the information in this Offer.

Description of this mortgage\r\nThis Offer is for a Capital Choice Midi Drawdown provided by more 2 life Limited. Your mortgage includes\r\na cash facility as discussed with your adviser. It provides you with a cash lump sum at the start of the loan\r\nand a cash facility which you may be able to draw cash from after your initial lump sum loan completion,\r\nsubject to a minimum withdrawal of \u00a32,000.00 or withdrawal of the remaining facility if less than \u00a32,000.00.\r\nThe amount of this facility is not guaranteed and we may reduce or remove this facility at any time. You\r\ncan apply direct to more 2 life Limited for further borrowing of the remaining amount of this facility without\r\nfurther financial advice. Any such further borrowing will be based on your property value and the terms\r\nand interest rates available from more 2 life Limited at the time. In particular, the interest rate applied to\r\nsuch further borrowing may be more or less than your initial interest rate. You do not have to make any\r\npayments during the life of this lifetime mortgage.\r\nCircumstances in which the cash facility may be reduced or removed include:\r\n\u2022 Where the total of all cash advances, rolled-up interest and other charges exceeds the maximum\r\nloan applicable at the time of applying to use the cash facility, based on your age and property\r\nvalue at the time.\r\n\u2022 Where you are in default under the mortgage conditions.\r\n\u2022 Where we no longer Offer new lifetime mortgages such as this one.\r\n\u2022 Where there are more than one of you and the property is owned by you as tenants in common\r\nbut one of you has died and not all appropriate documentation satisfactory to us has been provided\r\nto ensure the mortgage will secure the amount owed including the cash advance.\r\nAny such further borrowing will be subject to the interest rate available from more 2 life Limited at the time\r\nof application, which shall be based on the interest rates which would be applied by more 2 life Limited\r\nat such time to any new borrowing. This interest rate may be more or less than your initial interest rate. The\r\nOffer that we give to you at the time of any cash advance will set out the interest rate for that cash\r\nadvance.\r\nThis lifetime mortgage can only be arranged for either one or two people between the ages of 55 - 84,\r\nbased on the age of the youngest applicant, who own and live permanently in the property which is\r\nsubject to the lifetime mortgage.\r\nIf there are any other outstanding mortgages or charges at the time the loan is taken out, you will be\r\nrequired to use the lifetime mortgage to clear these loans. As part of the completion process our solicitors\r\nwill redeem them with the proceeds from the loan.\r\nInterest is charged at a fixed rate of 7.91% on the initial advance until receipt by more 2 life Limited of all\r\nmonies due. The interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly, meaning the interest rolls up\r\nwith interest being charged on that interest, paid when you repay your loan. See Section 8 for example.\r\nAny cash advances will be subject to the new interest rate payable at the time and set out in the Offer\r\nthat we give you for that cash advance, and which will then be fixed for the lifetime of the loan.\r\nWe have based this Offer on an estimated term of 18 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime\r\nmortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 18 years. If you are still living in your home at\r\nthe end of 18 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run.\r\nThe loan, accrued interest and charges that may be due, become payable out of the proceeds from the\r\nsale of your home under the following circumstances;\r\n\u2022 On your death, or (if joint borrowers) on the death of the last borrower.\r\n\u2022 If you move home and transferring this lifetime mortgage to the new property does not meet our\r\nlending conditions.\r\n\u2022If you move into residential or long-term care on the grounds of medical or other specialist advice.\r\nAny money left over would be paid to you or your beneficiaries.\r\nThe maximum amount you can borrow in one lump sum is \u00a3191,625.00. If you require additional funds you\r\nmay apply for further secured borrowing at any time subject to availability - see Section 14 for details.\r\nCC v1.33 1121 Page 4 of 15"}

The FCA require that this Offer is on an estimated term, as detailed in Section 5, but remember that the\r\nactual term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter. If you are still living in your\r\nown home at the end of this term, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run and the amount you owe\r\nwill continue to increase.\r\n2. more 2 life Limited has the right to take legal action to repossess your house in the following\r\ncircumstances:\r\n(a) the property not being sold within 12 months of your death (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the\r\ndeath of the last borrower) or your entering long-term care (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the last\r\nborrower entering long-term care) or otherwise vacating the property; (b) compulsory purchase or\r\nrequisition of all or any part of the property; (c) false information or omission in information given to more\r\n2 life Limited, including fraud or money laundering; (d) any failure to notify and co-operate with more 2\r\nlife Limited in relation to an environmental notice issued under the provisions of the Environmental\r\nProtection Act 1990 or the Water Resources Act 1991 relating to your property or a neighbouring property;\r\n(e) you use or permit the property to be used otherwise than solely as a private residence; (f) you are or\r\nbecome bankrupt or enter into a composition or other arrangement with any of your creditors or you have\r\nbeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been engaged in criminal activity; or (g) you\r\nare in default under the mortgage conditions.\r\n3. If negative equity arises, this will be dealt with under the no Negative Equity Guarantee as set out in\r\nSection 6. If your home is sold for more than the outstanding lifetime mortgage balance, which includes\r\ninterest, any unpaid charges and costs, you or your estate will receive the difference.\r\n4. If you move home and want to transfer this lifetime mortgage to the new property, you can do so if the\r\nnew property meets our lending conditions. You will have to pay a Valuation Fee, Arrangement Fee and\r\nour and your legal expenses in respect of the new property. If the new property is of a lower value, we\r\nmay ask you to repay part of the amount outstanding on the lifetime mortgage.\r\n5. If you move out of your home into long-term care or residential care your home must be sold and the\r\nlifetime mortgage repaid. Early repayment charges do not apply if this happens - they are only payable\r\nif you choose to repay your lifetime mortgage early. Section 13 of this Offer tells you when they are\r\npayable.\r\n6. If you want someone else to move into your home to live with you, for example; upon marriage/the\r\nformation of a civil partnership, or where someone acts as your carer, you must first get more 2 life Limited\r\nto agree before they move in. Otherwise this will breach the terms of your mortgage. Any persons that\r\nare currently residing at the property and are not party to the loan may have to sign a waiver in order to\r\ncontinue living in the property.\r\n7. You must keep your home in good repair. If you do not keep your home in good repair, more 2 life\r\nLimited has the right to inspect the property and get the repairs done, but they will tell you first if they\r\nintend to do this. The cost of any repairs that more 2 life Limited has to arrange will be added to the amount\r\nyou owe on this lifetime mortgage. Where such costs are not able to be reclaimed on the sale of the\r\nproperty, they may be excluded from the no Negative Equity Guarantee (see Section 6).\r\n8. Taking out this mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits, and may also affect\r\nyour tax position. Tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need\r\nfurther advice you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, the Pension Service, Benefits Agency or your\r\nlocal Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau.\r\n9. The property must currently be mortgage free, or if there is a mortgage outstanding then this must be\r\neither repaid before or at the time the lifetime mortgage begins. You can use the funds released through\r\nthe lifetime mortgage to do this, but no second or subsequent mortgages over the property will be allowed\r\nat any time.\r\n10. Once the mortgage has been set up, you will not be able to add another person to it, even if your\r\ncircumstances change.\r\n11. You have an obligation to maintain buildings insurance on the property that the loan is secured against\r\nwhich must be adequate to cover the cost of rebuilding the property for that period of cover, and note\r\nour interest on the property in the policy.\r\n12. We may be willing to lend you more in the future, but we have no obligation to do so. Any further\r\nborrowing (including drawings of your remaining cash facility) will be based on the prevailing lending\r\ncriteria. The amount of your cash facility is not guaranteed and the facility may be reduced or withdrawn\r\nat any time. Please see Section 5 for further details.\r\n13. Interest rates may go up before you draw down additional borrowing from your cash facility, and the\r\ninterest rate you receive from us in respect of any additional borrowing may reflect this.

What is a lifetime mortgage?\r\nImportant Information From The Financial Conduct Authority:\r\n\u2022A lifetime mortgage is a special type of loan which is usually designed to run for the rest of your life,\r\nand which means that you borrow money that is secured on your home to give you a lump sum/or\r\na regular income. The amount you owe to the lender is usually paid back from the proceeds of the\r\nsale of your home after death. If you are borrowing with someone else this would be after the death\r\nof the last borrower. Any money left over would be paid to your beneficiaries.\r\n\u2022If you buy a new home, you may be able to transfer your lifetime mortgage to your new home, or\r\nyou may be able to get a new lifetime mortgage. Otherwise you will usually have to repay the\r\namount you owe to the lender from the money you get from the sale of your home.

Again, any\r\nmoney left over belongs to you. If you are borrowing jointly with someone else and one of you needs\r\nto move into long-term care, you don\u2019t usually have to sell your home until the last borrower either\r\ndies or moves into long-term care or another property.\r\n\u2022If you decide that you simply don\u2019t want the lifetime mortgage any more, you can repay the amount\r\nyou owe to the lender at any time, but the lender may make an early repayment charge if you do.\r\nSection 13 of this Offer will tell you if any early repayment charges apply to this mortgage.\r\n\u2022Some lifetime mortgages are linked to an investment \u2013 this means you borrow a lump sum which is\r\ninvested (for example in an annuity) to give you a regular income. If this happens the full details of\r\nthe investment will be shown in a separate document and it is important to read both documents\r\ntogether.\r\n4.

Description of this mortgage\r\nThis Offer is for a Capital Choice Midi Drawdown provided by more 2 life Limited. Your mortgage includes\r\na cash facility as discussed with your adviser. It provides you with a cash lump sum at the start of the loan\r\nand a cash facility which you may be able to draw cash from after your initial lump sum loan completion,\r\nsubject to a minimum withdrawal of \u00a32,000.00 or withdrawal of the remaining facility if less than \u00a32,000.00.\r\nThe amount of this facility is not guaranteed and we may reduce or remove this facility at any time. You\r\ncan apply direct to more 2 life Limited for further borrowing of the remaining amount of this facility without\r\nfurther financial advice. Any such further borrowing will be based on your property value and the terms\r\nand interest rates available from more 2 life Limited at the time. In particular, the interest rate applied to\r\nsuch further borrowing may be more or less than your initial interest rate. You do not have to make any\r\npayments during the life of this lifetime mortgage.\r\nCircumstances in which the cash facility may be reduced or removed include:\r\n\u2022 Where the total of all cash advances, rolled-up interest and other charges exceeds the maximum\r\nloan applicable at the time of applying to use the cash facility, based on your age and property\r\nvalue at the time.\r\n\u2022 Where you are in default under the mortgage conditions.\r\n\u2022 Where we no longer Offer new lifetime mortgages such as this one.\r\n\u2022 Where there are more than one of you and the property is owned by you as tenants in common\r\nbut one of you has died and not all appropriate documentation satisfactory to us has been provided\r\nto ensure the mortgage will secure the amount owed including the cash advance.\r\nAny such further borrowing will be subject to the interest rate available from more 2 life Limited at the time\r\nof application, which shall be based on the interest rates which would be applied by more 2 life Limited\r\nat such time to any new borrowing. This interest rate may be more or less than your initial interest rate. The\r\nOffer that we give to you at the time of any cash advance will set out the interest rate for that cash\r\nadvance.\r\nThis lifetime mortgage can only be arranged for either one or two people between the ages of 55 - 84,\r\nbased on the age of the youngest applicant, who own and live permanently in the property which is\r\nsubject to the lifetime mortgage.\r\nIf there are any other outstanding mortgages or charges at the time the loan is taken out, you will be\r\nrequired to use the lifetime mortgage to clear these loans. As part of the completion process our solicitors\r\nwill redeem them with the proceeds from the loan.\r\nInterest is charged at a fixed rate of 7.91% on the initial advance until receipt by more 2 life Limited of all\r\nmonies due. The interest is calculated daily and added to the loan monthly, meaning the interest rolls up\r\nwith interest being charged on that interest, paid when you repay your loan. See Section 8 for example.\r\nAny cash advances will be subject to the new interest rate payable at the time and set out in the Offer\r\nthat we give you for that cash advance, and which will then be fixed for the lifetime of the loan.\r\nWe have based this Offer on an estimated term of 18 years, but remember that the term of this lifetime\r\nmortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter than 18 years. If you are still living in your home at\r\nthe end of 18 years, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run.\r\nThe loan, accrued interest and charges that may be due, become payable out of the proceeds from the\r\nsale of your home under the following circumstances;\r\n\u2022 On your death, or (if joint borrowers) on the death of the last borrower.\r\n\u2022 If you move home and transferring this lifetime mortgage to the new property does not meet our\r\nlending conditions.\r\n\u2022If you move into residential or long-term care on the grounds of medical or other specialist advice.\r\nAny money left over would be paid to you or your beneficiaries.\r\nThe maximum amount you can borrow in one lump sum is \u00a3191,625.00. If you require additional funds you\r\nmay apply for further secured borrowing at any time subject to availability - see Section 14 for details.\r\nCC v1.33 1121 Page 4 of 15"}

The FCA require that this Offer is on an estimated term, as detailed in Section 5, but remember that the\r\nactual term of this lifetime mortgage is not fixed and could be longer or shorter. If you are still living in your\r\nown home at the end of this term, the lifetime mortgage will continue to run and the amount you owe\r\nwill continue to increase.\r\n2. more 2 life Limited has the right to take legal action to repossess your house in the following\r\ncircumstances:\r\n(a) the property not being sold within 12 months of your death (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the\r\ndeath of the last borrower) or your entering long-term care (or, in the case of joint borrowers of the last\r\nborrower entering long-term care) or otherwise vacating the property; (b) compulsory purchase or\r\nrequisition of all or any part of the property; (c) false information or omission in information given to more\r\n2 life Limited, including fraud or money laundering; (d) any failure to notify and co-operate with more 2\r\nlife Limited in relation to an environmental notice issued under the provisions of the Environmental\r\nProtection Act 1990 or the Water Resources Act 1991 relating to your property or a neighbouring property;\r\n(e) you use or permit the property to be used otherwise than solely as a private residence; (f) you are or\r\nbecome bankrupt or enter into a composition or other arrangement with any of your creditors or you have\r\nbeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been engaged in criminal activity; or (g) you\r\nare in default under the mortgage conditions.\r\n3. If negative equity arises, this will be dealt with under the no Negative Equity Guarantee as set out in\r\nSection 6. If your home is sold for more than the outstanding lifetime mortgage balance, which includes\r\ninterest, any unpaid charges and costs, you or your estate will receive the difference.\r\n4. If you move home and want to transfer this lifetime mortgage to the new property, you can do so if the\r\nnew property meets our lending conditions. You will have to pay a Valuation Fee, Arrangement Fee and\r\nour and your legal expenses in respect of the new property. If the new property is of a lower value, we\r\nmay ask you to repay part of the amount outstanding on the lifetime mortgage.\r\n5. If you move out of your home into long-term care or residential care your home must be sold and the\r\nlifetime mortgage repaid. Early repayment charges do not apply if this happens - they are only payable\r\nif you choose to repay your lifetime mortgage early. Section 13 of this Offer tells you when they are\r\npayable.\r\n6. If you want someone else to move into your home to live with you, for example; upon marriage/the\r\nformation of a civil partnership, or where someone acts as your carer, you must first get more 2 life Limited\r\nto agree before they move in. Otherwise this will breach the terms of your mortgage. Any persons that\r\nare currently residing at the property and are not party to the loan may have to sign a waiver in order to\r\ncontinue living in the property.\r\n7. You must keep your home in good repair. If you do not keep your home in good repair, more 2 life\r\nLimited has the right to inspect the property and get the repairs done, but they will tell you first if they\r\nintend to do this. The cost of any repairs that more 2 life Limited has to arrange will be added to the amount\r\nyou owe on this lifetime mortgage. Where such costs are not able to be reclaimed on the sale of the\r\nproperty, they may be excluded from the no Negative Equity Guarantee (see Section 6).\r\n8. Taking out this mortgage may affect your ability to claim social security benefits, and may also affect\r\nyour tax position. Tax and social security benefits may change and if you are worried about this and need\r\nfurther advice you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, the Pension Service, Benefits Agency or your\r\nlocal Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau.\r\n9. The property must currently be mortgage free, or if there is a mortgage outstanding then this must be\r\neither repaid before or at the time the lifetime mortgage begins. You can use the funds released through\r\nthe lifetime mortgage to do this, but no second or subsequent mortgages over the property will be allowed\r\nat any time.\r\n10. Once the mortgage has been set up, you will not be able to add another person to it, even if your\r\ncircumstances change.\r\n11. You have an obligation to maintain buildings insurance on the property that the loan is secured against\r\nwhich must be adequate to cover the cost of rebuilding the property for that period of cover, and note\r\nour interest on the property in the policy.\r\n12. We may be willing to lend you more in the future, but we have no obligation to do so. Any further\r\nborrowing (including drawings of your remaining cash facility) will be based on the prevailing lending\r\ncriteria. The amount of your cash facility is not guaranteed and the facility may be reduced or withdrawn\r\nat any time. Please see Section 5 for further details.\r\n13. Interest rates may go up before you draw down additional borrowing from your cash facility, and the\r\ninterest rate you receive from us in respect of any additional borrowing may reflect this.

We will provide you with an Offer confirming the interest rate and the APR each time we\r\nagree to your request for additional borrowing.\r\nThe following example shows how your lifetime mortgage could change over the example term of\r\n18 years if you borrowed the whole of your cash facility on completion of your lifetime mortgage. It also\r\nshows the maximum early repayment charge which could apply. This is based on the current interest rate\r\nof 7.91%.\r\nMaximum loan amount What you will owe at the end of\r\n18 yearsMaximum early repayment\r\ncharge\r\n\u00a3191,625.00 \u00a3792,221.43 \u00a314,210.90\r\nRemember that the lifetime mortgage could run for a longer or shorter time than 18 years and if it runs for\r\nlonger, the amount you owe will carry on increasing.\r\nAny additional borrowing must be repaid in full at the same time as the initial loan you received at the\r\nstart of the lifetime mortgage.\r\nThe early repayment charges and conditions shown in Section 13 above may apply if you choose to repay\r\nyour lifetime mortgage early.\r\nAdditional Secured Borrowing\r\nYou may apply for additional funds over and above your cash facility against your home at any time by\r\napplication to more 2 life Limited. The amount available will depend upon the current value of your home,\r\nyour age, the condition of the property at time of application and the outstanding loan balance.\r\nAdditional funds are not guaranteed at any time during the life of the loan.\r\nThis will increase the amount of borrowing secured on your home.\r\nAdditional fees may apply which are detailed in the Tariff of Charges applicable at the time of application.\r\nOverpayments\r\nYou can make partial repayments of up to 10% of the initial loan amount within each 12 month period,\r\nstarting from the date your loan completes, without incurring an early repayment charge. If unused the\r\n10% partial repayment amount cannot be carried forward in whole or part to subsequent 12 month\r\nperiods. Any partial repayments over 10% within each 12 month period will be subject to early repayment\r\ncharges, see Section 13 for details. The minimum partial repayment amount is \u00a350.\r\nWhen you make a partial repayment we will apply this on the date the funds have cleared into our bank\r\naccount and the amount on which we charge interest will reduce. We will send you a statement to show\r\nhow your lifetime mortgage has reduced.\r\nAny partial repayment you make will not affect your right to repay the full amount, early repayment\r\ncharges may apply, see Section 13 for details.\r\nCC v1.33 1121 Page 12 of 15"}

Sometimes You will not be able \nto insure your property  yourself because someone else has the legal obligation to \ninsure.  An example of that would  be if the Property  is leasehold and the lease  \nrequires Your landlord to insure it. In that case, You must do all You  reasonably  \ncan to make sure that Your landlord insures  it. \n4.8.2  The insurance policy  must:  \n4.8.2.1  be with a reputable insurer and be for the full Reinstatement  Value;  \n4.8.2.2  cover fire, subsidence, flood, aircraft damage and such other  risks  \nas We may from time to time reasonably require;  and \n4.8.2.3  be on risk immediately before exchange of contracts in relation to \nYour purchase of the Property, or the date on which the advance  \nmonies are issued to Our solicitors, whichever is the earliest. If  You \nare re- mortgaging the Property it must be insured from at least  two \nworking days before completion of your  Mortgage.  \n4.8.3  If You arrange insurance,  \n4.8.3.1  You must pay the insurance premiums on time;  and \n4.8.3.2  whenever We ask, you must show Us a copy of the policy  and \nproduce receipts or other evidence that it is on risk and its \npremiums are paid up to date.  \nThe \"Reinstatement Value\" is the amount (including Value Added Tax)  required:  \n\u2022 to demolish and/or rebuild the Property;  \n\u2022 for site clearance of the  Property;  \n\u2022 to pay surveyors and other professional  fees;  \n\u2022 to comply with planning permissions; and  \n\u2022 to pay for alternative accommodation.  \nThat amount must be adjusted at least once a year in accordance with any \nchange in the House Rebuilding Cost Index prepared by the Royal Institute of \nChartered Surveyors or, if that index ceases to exist, such similar index as We in Our reasonable discretion decide.  \n4.8.4  You shall ensure that Our interest as mortgage lender is protected in one of the following ways, as We require in the Lifetime Mortgage Offer:  \n4.8.4.1  Insured with Us and You as co- insureds on a composite basis;  \n4.8.4.2  Insured with Us and You as joint insureds; or  \n4.8.4.3  With Our interest as mortgage lender noted on the insurance policy.  \nWe will be entitled to require You, by giving You notice, to ensure that Our interest is protected in one of the other ways if it is Our reasonable opinion that "}

Our insurance \nmay not cover Your interests or the interests of anyone else at all, or if any of Your or anyone else's interests are covered, they might only be partly covered.  \n4.8.9  You can at any time ask Us for details of any insurance We have put in place.

Where the insurance allows, We will have a right to negotiate with the insurer and settle a claim on reasonable terms.  \n4.9 Proceeds from insurance  claims  \nYou must ensure that all money payable under any insurance in respect of loss or damage to the Property, whether effected or maintained pursuant to paragraph 4.8 above or otherwise, shall be paid to Us or, if it is paid to You, You must hold all money received on trust for Us.

This means  that if You have  more than one property  \nmortgaged to Us and You want  to pay off just one of those mortgages,  We can refuse to redeem  \nthe mortgages  separately  and insist  that You pay off all of them,  before redeeming any of them.  \n6 Using Our  rights  \n6.1 Where  You need Our consent  under  these Conditions  before doing  something,  We will not \nunreasonably  withhold  or delay  that consent.  For example,  it will be reasonable for Us to refuse  \nto consent to something We reasonably think  will: \n6.1.1  make it less likely You can pay Us all Amounts Owed at any  time;  \n6.1.2  negatively affect Our Mortgage or the value of the Property;  or \n6.1.3  have any significant negative impact on Us in relation to the Mortgage.  \nWhere  You need Our consent  before doing  something,  You will need it before going  ahead and \nYou should therefore ask for consent in good time before going  ahead.  \n6.2 Where:  \n6.2.1  We have the power to require You to take or not to take certain action;   \n6.2.2  something must be to Our satisfaction or must be acceptable to  Us; or  \n6.2.3  or a document must be in Our required form,  \nthen, unless otherwise specified, We will act reasonably when exercising these rights.  For \nexample,  We will be acting  reasonably  if We act as a prudent  lender  would.  \n7 Enforcement of security \n7.1 Powers to be exercisable without  restrictions  \n7.1.1  Section 103 of the Act shall not apply  to the Mortgage.  Failure to pay the Secured  \nSums  as and when  they become  due or any other  breach  by You of the covenants  \nand conditions contained in the Mortgage or in the Loan Agreement, shall  result  in \nthe Mortgage becoming enforceable and the powers conferred upon Us by  the Act \nand the Mortgage becoming immediately exercisable without the restrictions  \ncontained in the Act as to the giving  of notice or otherwise with respect  to the whole  \nor any part of the Property. Section 103 of the Act says that We cannot use Our \npower  to sell the Property  until certain  conditions  have been  met. If We did not \ndisapply  them,  the conditions  would  mean,  for example,  that if We issued a notice  \nasking You  to make  a payment,  We would  have  to give you three months  to make  \nthe payment before exercising Our right to sell. \n7.1.2  In connection  with exercising  Our powers,  in Our discretion,  We may appoint  You \nor Your Personal Representative(s) as Our agent to market the Property on Our \nbehalf.

You are required to \r\nexplain the terms and implications of the plan to your client and, having done so, sign the Certificate.  The provider \r\nwill not complete the transaction until they have received a Certificate which has been signed and completed by \r\nboth you and your client(s), whereby you confirm that you have drawn your client\u2019s(s\u2019) attention to the risks of \r\nentering into an equity release transaction and your client(s) confirms that he/they has/have been given the advice \r\nset out in the Certificate.\r\nGuidance on Independence \r\nClients must use a legal adviser who is independent of the provider\u2019s solicitor.  If you are advising a client in relation \r\nto an equity release transaction, the Equity Release Council requires you to consider whether you are independent \r\nof the provider firm or the adviser advising the client on the transaction, by following EITHER \u2013\r\n \r\n\u00b7 the Solicitor\u2019s Code of Conduct 2011 (as amended) (for transactions which take place in England or \r\nWales); or\r\n\u00b7 the Handbook published by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers; or\r\n\u00b7 the Solicitors (Scotland) Standards of Conduct, which are contained in Rule B1 of the Law Society of \r\nScotland\u2019s Practice Rules 2011, which came into force on 1 November 2011, for transactions which \r\ntake place within Scotland; AND, in all cases these guidance notes on the Equity Release Council\u2019s \r\nRules & Guidance\r\nPayment of Fees \r\nWhilst you may make payments to an introducer for genuine marketing initiatives, such payments are subject to \r\nthis guidance.  You may not make such a payment, or give other consideration, to a third party who refers clients \r\nto you, unless you can show that the payment is wholly unconnected with the referral of any specific client to \r\nyou.  You are therefore not permitted to pay referral fees on a case-by-case basis.  Additionally, payments may not \r\nbe calculated or aggregated on the basis of the number of cases referred.\r\nThis also applies regardless of how any referral fee payment (or other consideration) is described if it is connected \r\nwith the payment of fees on a case-by-case-basis.  For example, this would apply to the payment of administrative \r\nor marketing fees, payments described as \"disbursements\" which are not proper disbursements, and panel \r\nmembership fees.  \"Other consideration\" might include, for example, the provision of services and secondment of \r\nstaff to the introducer, or an agreement to purchase services or products from the introducer (where such provision \r\nor purchase is a condition of referrals on a case-by-case basis being made).  For the avoidance of doubt, certain \r\nmarketing payments which are not connected with payment on a case-by-case basis are permitted, subject to the \r\nregulatory obligations of the parties concerned. You must inform your client(s) in writing of the amount and \r\nfrequency of any financial arrangement, including marketing contributions, when issuing the customer case \r\ndocumentation at the outset.\r\nIf the customer chooses not to instruct their own legal adviser, the adviser or provider (as appropriate) may offer \r\nthe name of at least one local law firm which has knowledge of equity release products.  The adviser or provider \r\nmust ensure that no pressure or financial inducement is involved in directing customers to any particular law firm \r\neither by them or the intermediaries recommending their products.\r\nReceipt of Payments \r\nIf you are acting on behalf of the client you may not receive payments or other consideration from the adviser or \r\nprovider if that payment is dependent on the completion of an equity release transaction.

The Report is not exhaustive and you should\r\nalso read the offer conditions in the More 2 Life literature carefully before proceeding.

Your offer was issued on 28/11/2022 and is valid for 40 days from that date.  In order to accept your\r\noffer, the signed mortgage documents must be with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors no later than 5 working days prior to the expiry date. As the offer expires on\r\n09/01/2023 we would need to send signed papers to More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors no later than 02/01/2023. \r\nIf this timescale is not met, More 2 Life will re-offer, at their prevailing interest rate (which may be higher).  If the mortgage re-offer is at a higher rate of\r\ninterest this will increase the amount paid over the lifetime of the loan or, if you are servicing the interest payments, these will rise and you should ensure\r\nthat this is affordable.  Please speak to your financial adviser for an illustration of the rolled up interest at the new rate.\r\nWhilst Equilaw cannot take any responsibility for the change in interest rate, and cannot guarantee a completion by the expiry date, we will work with you\r\nto bring your plan to completion in the shortest time possible.  To achieve this we would be grateful if you could be as flexible as possible regarding\r\nappointment dates/times,  and return documents to us as quickly as possible (ideally by Special Delivery or by hand where possible). \r\nOnce we have received all required documents we estimate that completion will be within 10 working days, this timescale is only an estimate and is not\r\nguaranteed. \r\nIf we need information from a third party (eg, an existing mortgage provider or landlord), we may also ask for your assistance in chasing up the\r\ninformation for speed.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Equilaw cannot be held liable if you do not meet the deadline to achieve the current rate of interest.\r\nIf we have not yet been in contact to book your solicitors appointment, we will do so shortly or, if you prefer, please contact Jordan Swinburn.\r\nWe would be grateful if you could please have photographic identification available at your solicitors appointment (driving licence and passport are the\r\nmost frequently used).

Our solicitors appointment usually\r\ntakes up to 20 minutes but occasionally, to allow you to access our service, it may be necessary for a double length appointment to be booked.

Equilaw cannot give you any financial advice regarding the plan\u2019s suitability for your circumstances and\r\nrequirements, now or in the future.  If you are not absolutely certain that the plan is right for you, please take further advice from your\r\nfinancial adviser before proceeding further.\r\nIf you intend to use the proceeds of the equity release to buy investment products, please ensure that you have sought further financial\r\nadvice, from your financial adviser, because the rate of return on the investment may not exceed the interest charged on this product.  \r\nAny existing mortgage, loans or debt secured against the Property must be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release.  If you do\r\nnot intend to repay these existing debts, please speak to your financial adviser before proceeding further.  Unless we hear from you to\r\nthe contrary, we will proceed on this basis and you understand that the effect of repaying debts will reduce the balance of the equity\r\nrelease funds paid to you on completion. \r\nAdditionally, equity release lenders may require you to repay other outstanding loans, such as credit cards, using the proceeds of the\r\nequity release.  The effect of this is to convert an unsecured debt into a debt secured against your home.  Please ensure that you have\r\nreviewed this carefully with your financial adviser to ensure that this is the best course of action in your circumstances.  If this applies in\r\nyour case, you will find details in the \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d section of this report.\r\nYou may be considering making a gift of some or all of the loan either as part of an estate planning scheme (i.e. to mitigate inheritance\r\ntax) or to try to protect your assets against being used to pay for residential/nursing home care fees.  The rules and regulations relating\r\nto gifts for these purposes are complicated and continually changing. The equity release should not be entered into, for this purpose,\r\nwithout careful consideration and obtaining specialist legal/financial advice. \r\nPlease also remember that making a substantial gift of the equity release proceeds can have implications for your own quality of life.\r\n Further information and guidance is produced by Age UK and can be found at \r\nwww.ageuk.org.uk/publications/age-uk-information-\r\nguides-and-factsheets/\r\n.\r\nIt is important to review and/or make a Will in the context of taking out an equity release plan.  Making a Will can achieve significant\r\nsavings in tax and costs of winding up your estate.  It also means that your assets will be distributed in accordance with your wishes and\r\nnot as provided for by the general laws of intestacy.  You should also consider making a Lasting Power of Attorney, which can safeguard\r\nyour position and ensure that your wishes are carried out in relation to the Property, health and finances in the event that you become\r\nincapable of handling these decisions personally in the future.  If you would like to discuss these matters please let me know and I will\r\nput you in touch with an appropriate specialist.\r\nYou should read this report, together with the Mortgage Deed, the Loan Agreement and the More 2 Life Mortgage Terms and Conditions\r\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Conditions\") before committing to the scheme.  \r\nIf there are any aspects of this report that you do not understand, please contact Jordan Swinburn or your financial adviser Vijay Ghudial\r\nbefore you proceed. You should not go ahead with the scheme until you are satisfied that you fully understand its effect and are happy\r\nwith it.\r\nFraud Warning\r\nWe will never telephone you or email asking you to send money to a specific bank account without additional corroboration or security\r\nmeasures being applied. We will also never ask you to send funds to any third party directly. If you receive any telephone call or email\r\nmessage that claims to be from us and asks you to do anything unusual, especially if it involves sending money, then please call us\r\nimmediately using our main office telephone number which can be found on our letterhead. \r\n7"}

What is the Equity Release Scheme?\r\n1.1\r\nProduct Type\r\nFollowing advice from your financial adviser, Vijay Ghudial, More 2 Life Capital Choice Midi Drawdown Lifetime Mortgage,\r\nLifetime General Loan Conditions and Mortgage Conditions (2020 ED-v1) has been selected as the most suitable product for\r\nyour requirements.  This is a lifetime mortgage, which means you retain ownership of your home.\r\n1.2\r\nAmount of Loan\r\nThe maximum amount that More 2 Life are willing to lend is \u00a3191,625.00. At the date of completion, you will receive a lump\r\nsum of \u00a3150,000.00, subject to any deductions (existing mortgage, legal and financial fees). You will also have access to a\r\ncash facility of \u00a341,624.90.\r\nMore 2 Life will register a first and only legal charge (i.e., mortgage) against the Property as security for this loan.\r\nYou can apply to More 2 Life for Additional Borrowing.  More 2 Life is not obliged to lend further sums but will consider the\r\nrequest in accordance with its current lending criteria and terms, as at the time of request.\r\n1.3\r\nCash Facility\r\nFollowing completion, you will have access to a Cash Facility of \u00a341,624.90.\r\nYou will not be charged interest on the Cash Facility until you draw funds from it.  When you do withdraw funds, More 2 Life\r\nwill charge interest at its prevailing rate at the time, which may be higher OR lower than the original rate in this offer of\r\n7.91%.  Please ensure that you check the interest rate to be charged before proceeding to draw any funds from the Cash\r\nFacility.  \r\nYou can apply at any time, to More 2 Life to borrow any amount within your Cash Facility subject to a minimum amount of\r\n\u00a32,000.00.  \r\nPlease note that the Cash Facility can be withdrawn by More 2 Life at any time following completion, as outlined in Section 5\r\nof your Mortgage Offer.  If this is likely to pose a problem for you, you should speak to your financial adviser immediately and\r\nbefore you proceed any further. \r\n1.4\r\nInterest\r\nThe interest payable on the loan is fixed for the duration of the loan and is charged at 7.91%.  Interest is calculated daily and\r\nadded to the loan monthly. \r\nYou are not required to make any repayments (interest or capital) during the life of the loan. Unpaid interest will be added to\r\nthe loan amount and will be charged on top of the original borrowed amount (\u201crolling up\u201d). The interest continues to roll up,\r\nat the fixed rate, until the loan is repaid.   Over a long period of time this can reach high levels (if you are not making any\r\nperiodic voluntary repayments).  If house prices do not rise, at a corresponding level, the equity in the Property will be\r\neroded and may totally eliminate all equity, depending on how much you are borrowing against the value of the Property. \r\nThe requirement to repay the loan is triggered once the Property has been abandoned. This will either be because you have\r\ndied, moved into long term care or no longer wish to live at the Property. Please note that interest continues to roll up until\r\nthe mortgage has actually been repaid (usually as a result of selling the Property); it will not stop just because you are no\r\nlonger living there.\r\nSection 8 of the Offer provides an illustration of the interest that will accrue over the estimated loan period.

This means if, at the date of repayment of the mortgage loan, you or\r\nyour estate owe more than the value of your home, More 2 Life will not seek to recover any further amount than the\r\nproceeds of sale.  \r\nThis guarantee is only available provided you have adhered to the Terms and Conditions of the plan.  For example, keeping\r\nthe Property in good repair and condition.  The guarantee would not apply to those monies spend on carrying out repairs by\r\nMore 2 Life. \r\nThe guarantee only applies when the Property is sold to repay the loan.  It will not apply if your beneficiaries wish to keep the\r\nProperty and repay the loan, or should you wish to move house as the total debt secured on your Property will reduce the\r\navailable equity for a new Property. \r\nAll of the lenders that belong to the Equity Release Council offer a \u201cno-negative equity guarantee\u201d which means that if the\r\nlevel of the loan outstrips the value of your property when it is sold, the lender cannot pursue you or your estate for any\r\nshortfall. However, there is very likely to be a cost built in to the loan in return for offering this guarantee.  This is not\r\nspecified anywhere by the lender, or broken down, so I cannot advise you what it is costing (if anything).  The downside is\r\nthat if your property value is always more than the loan, you could be paying for a feature of the product that you do not\r\nneed.  However, if the loan does outstrip the property value, you may find the guarantee very valuable.  There is not\r\ncurrently an \u201cEquity Release Council approved\u201d product which does not carry this guarantee, so if you want a product which\r\nmeets Council standards, there is no alternative.  If you are unhappy about this, we strongly suggest that you speak to your\r\nfinancial adviser immediately to explore any other options which may be available to you.\r\n1.7\r\nOnce the loan is made, it should be regarded as a long-term arrangement and possibly irreversible, depending on the size of\r\nthe loan you are taking, versus the value of your Property.\r\nCompound interest will roll up and reduce the equity remaining (either to leave to your heirs or for you to use in future).\r\n1.8\r\nMoving House\r\nIt is possible to move to a different Property, under the terms of the scheme (please see More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions)\r\nprovided that the Property you want to move to is acceptable to More 2 Life.  However, this is not guaranteed.  Examples of\r\nwhere More 2 Life may not agree to transfer the mortgage to another Property might include a flat, where the lease does not\r\nhave enough years remaining or, perhaps, where the Property is of non-standard construction.\r\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to \u201cporting\u201d your mortgage to a new Property, if your planned new home is of a lower value than\r\nyour current home, you may be required to repay some of the loan.  No early repayment charges will apply in these\r\ncircumstances. If you intend to move home and wish to port this loan to your new home, you must involve More 2 Life from\r\nthe outset.  The solicitors acting in your purchase need to interact with More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors at all stages to ensure that\r\nMore 2 Life is satisfied as to the title of the new property and are willing to (continue to) lend.  Only once More 2 Life have\r\nconfirmed that they are satisfied as to the title of the new property will their solicitors provide your solicitors authority to\r\nexchange.  You must not progress the transaction to this stage where you are contractually obliged to purchase the new\r\nproperty without More 2 Life\u2019s consent.\r\nIf your proposed new Property is not acceptable to More 2 Life you will need to repay the amount owed which may attract\r\nan early repayment charge.\r\nIf your proposed new home does not meet More 2 Life's lending criteria, or you no longer require the mortgage, no early\r\nrepayment charge will apply. Furthermore, if you decide to move and repay your loan in full as a result of the first borrower\r\ndying or moving into long-term care you will also be able to do so without early repayment charge.\r\nYou should always obtain More 2 Life's agreement before seeking to move to avoid incurring any significant expenditure in\r\nthe event that this is not possible\r\n1.9\r\nSale of Part of your Property \r\nIf you are seeking to sell part of your Property, for example, part of the garden, you must tell More 2 Life and seek More 2\r\nLife\u2019s prior consent.  If the sale of part of your Property reduces the value of your Property you may be required to repay\r\nsome of the loan. \r\nNo early repayment charges will apply in these circumstances.\r\n1.10\r\nTaxation on the Loan\r\n9"}

The new occupier will\r\nbe required to sign the Lender's Occupier's Waiver form and must receive independent legal advice (the occupier will be\r\nresponsible for the legal fees) before they move in.\r\nIf you want the new person to be added onto the mortgage it will be necessary to redeem this loan and apply for a new loan\r\nin the name of the proposed joint owners.\r\nIf More 2 Life are agreeable to the new person becoming a joint borrower/owner of your home, you may be required to\r\nrepay part of the loan (without early repayment charge).\r\n3.4\r\nResidence\r\nThis must be your main residence i.e. where you are registered to vote and keep your possessions. If you are planning to\r\nleave your Property empty for 3 months or longer, you must inform More 2 Life of your intention, and seek its permission to\r\ndo so.  \r\nIt is important that you do this so that More 2 Life does not consider you to have moved out permanently (in accordance\r\nwith its definitions) as this would trigger the requirement for the sale of the Property and repayment of the loan, potentially\r\nincurring early redemption charges.  \r\nYou must also inform your buildings insurer, who may ask you to take steps to secure the Property.  Usually this is a\r\nrequirement if you are planning to leave the Property empty for 30 days or more.\r\n3.5\r\nYou can live in the Property for as long as you either want or need to (provided that you do not breach any of the mortgage\r\nconditions).  Please carefully read More 2 Life\u2019s Terms and Conditions paying particular attention to the legal definitions\r\n(including what constitutes early repayment, your obligations and default under the Terms and Conditions). \r\n3.6\r\nRight to Inspect the Property\r\nMore 2 Life is entitled to inspect the Property periodically to ensure that the Terms and Conditions of the loan are being\r\ncomplied with.  More 2 Life will provide you with reasonable notice of its intention if it decides to inspect (except in cases of\r\nemergency), which you cannot reasonably refuse.  This is an entirely standard condition in most residential mortgages and is\r\nset out at Section 10 in the Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.7\r\nRepair & Maintenance\r\nYou have agreed to keep the Property in good repair and condition to ensure that its value is not adversely affected by letting\r\nit fall into disrepair.\r\nIf More 2 Life chooses to exercise its right to inspect, and requires maintenance work to be undertaken, this must be done\r\nwithin the time stipulated or More 2 Life is entitled to send its own workmen to carry out the work and will charge you for it.\r\n If you cannot or do not reimburse them for the cost of these works, the outstanding sum will be added to your mortgage\r\nand interest then added to it, which will compound and roll up.\r\nPlease also note that if you do not keep the Property in reasonable condition the costs incurred, as a result of carrying out\r\nthe repairs, will not be subject to the no-negative equity guarantee.\r\n3.8\r\nInsurance\r\nYou must keep the Property fully insured, by a company approved by More 2 Life, for all usual and comprehensive risks to\r\n12"}

Lenders do not usually withhold consent\r\nunreasonably, but there may be certain types of property development which do not fall within their lending criteria (and\r\nbasements can often fall into this category), so it is better to be certain before committing to any projects.\r\nIf you wish to apply for an improvement grant (or similar) or government initiative (such as Green Deal) you must first obtain\r\nthe written permission of More 2 Life to do so (usually in case this is secured against the Property, which is not allowed by\r\nMore 2 Life).\r\n3.12\r\nAcquiring additional land adjoining the Property\r\nIf you buy or acquire any land next to the Property please notify More 2 Life.  More 2 Life may require you to extend the\r\nmortgage to cover include this piece of land.  This is because the new piece of land may be of strategic importance to the\r\nProperty (e.g. for development) and the value can be affected if one piece of land is sold without the other. Please see More\r\n2 Lifes Terms and Conditions.\r\n3.13\r\nRenting out the Property\r\nYou cannot rent out the Property to tenants, rather than live in it yourself.  If you wish to do so, please contact More 2 Life.\r\nIf More 2 Life do not grant permission, you will need to re-mortgage using a \u201cBuy to Let\u201d loan.

This does not mean the mortgage\r\ncomes to an end at this time, but interest will continue to accrue and the overall repayment amount will increase.\r\n4.2\r\nImpact of Loan ending due to Death or Long Term Care \r\nIf the loan has ended because of entry into long term care then More 2 Life may request medical or other specialist evidence\r\nof the need for care, which cannot reasonably be refused.\r\nNo early repayment charges will be payable in these circumstances but interest will continue to roll up until such time as the\r\nloan is repaid (usually when the house is sold).\r\nThe term will also end on death.

If the Property is not sold within 12 months More 2 Life may take\r\nover conduct of the sale.  This would usually be if More 2 Life perceived no progress was being made and that this was\r\nunreasonable in the circumstances.\r\nBy signing the documentation and proceeding with the loan, you have agreed to appoint More 2 Life under a Power of\r\nAttorney in relation to the Property only, if the last borrower enters into long term care. That said, if you are still capable of\r\ndealing with your own affairs, or have your own Attorney, More 2 Life would not usually get involved. \r\nHowever, it does mean that More 2 Life can step in, if it needs to, to carry out any administration which relates to the\r\nProperty, including receiving any money due to you in relation to it (e.g. an insurance claim) or sale of the Property at the\r\nend of the loan, especially if nobody else is available or able to do so.\r\n4.4\r\nBankruptcy and/or Breach of Material Contract Terms \r\nThe loan becomes repayable in full, if you default on the terms of the contract, as set out in the Terms and Conditions,\r\nspecifically your obligations as set out in the Terms and Conditions.

This may incur early repayment charges.  If you are deemed to be in default the no negative equity\r\nguarantee will not extend to cover any costs incurred by More 2 Life as a result of the breaches.\r\nMore 2 Life will always try to treat you fairly and will give you an opportunity to remedy the breach.\r\nRepossession would always be a matter of last resort.\r\n7.2\r\nIf you move house you may need to repay some or all of the current loan, depending on circumstances.\r\nFurther additional secured borrowing from More 2 Life is not guaranteed. \r\n7.3\r\nIf you need to raise more money in future, it may be difficult to do, because an early repayment penalty may apply if you\r\nwished to re-mortgage with another lender.\r\n7.4\r\nIf the tax rules change and the government apply the new rules retrospectively you may find that you owe tax on the lump\r\nsum that you have taken. \r\n7.5\r\nIf you do not make any interest payments, the interest on this loan will roll-up and the cost of this interest plus the capital of\r\nthe loan will erode the equity available in the Property in due course (if you are not making any periodic voluntary\r\nrepayments) , particularly if the value of the Property does not go up over time.  This means that you would not be able to\r\nleave this Property or any part of it to beneficiaries under your Wills, but you can leave any remaining equity once the\r\nProperty have been sold.\r\n7.6\r\nEligibility for means-tested state benefits could be adversely effected. \r\n7.7\r\nAny existing charge secured against the Property will have to be repaid from the proceeds of your equity release plan, which\r\nwill reduce the amount you receive on completion.\r\n7.8\r\nIf your equity release funds are used to repay any outstanding unsecured debt you are effectively converting this into a debt\r\nsecured against your home.  You should ensure that your financial adviser has explained this to you to ensure that this is the\r\nbest course of action for you.  \r\n \r\nReward:\r\n7.9\r\nYou will receive the net proceeds of the loan for your immediate use.\r\n7.10\r\nThere is a no negative equity guarantee, meaning that you or your estate will never owe more than the value of your home\r\n(provided there are no breaches of the Terms and Conditions). \r\n7.11\r\nYou can potentially \u201cport\u201d this mortgage to a new Property if you want to move house.\r\n19"}

Legal advice is provided by us within this \u201cMortgage Report\u201d.  If you have any questions or queries\r\narising from this report, please direct these to Jordan Swinburn in advance of the appointment. \r\nIn preparation for the meeting please read the enclosed Document Checklist and ensure that all of documents listed are\r\navailable.  If any documents are missing, please contact Jordan Swinburn prior to the appointment so we can arrange for any\r\nreplacement documents to be sent to you in readiness.  If the missing documents are those in your care and control, but are\r\nunavailable, please contact Jordan Swinburn so that we can discuss how best to proceed.\r\nWe anticipate that the Solicitor will be present for approximately 15 minutes. Please note that only the equity release\r\napplicant(s) can be present for the solicitor's appointment. The solicitor will need to verify your identity at the appointment\r\nand take copies of the documentation provided.  Please ensure you have:\r\n\u2022    Valid photographic signature identification: i.e Passport, Driving Licence, National Identity Card AND Address verification:\r\ni.e bank statement;\r\n\u2022    Utility bill (not mobile telephone) valid within the last two months or your current Council Tax Bill naming each borrower.\r\nVery occasionally it may be necessary to have a further document witnessed by a solicitor after your initial signing\r\nappointment.  To minimise delay and cost, we are able to do this via Skype or Facetime.  If you are not able to access this via\r\nyour own (or a family/friends\u2019) mobile device, or via public computers at libraries then the alternative is to attend a local\r\nsolicitor who will charge \u00a35 per document \u2018witnessing fee\u2019.   If this is required, we will notify you and provide our\r\nSkype/Facetime address at that time and book a mutually convenient appointment. \r\n8.3\r\nCost of the Solicitor Appointment\r\nThe costs quoted within our estimated bill for the attending solicitor, are based on a 15 minute meeting.  If you cancel or fail\r\nto attend the appointment, without 24 hours' (one working days') notice, the attending solicitor will still require their fee to\r\nbe met.  If you can no longer make this appointment please contact us as a matter of urgency.  \r\n8.4\r\nIdentification\r\nWe must provide a \u201cguarantee\u201d of your identity to More 2 Life at the point of requesting completion.  To be able to give this\r\nguarantee we will need valid photographic Identity evidence i.e a driving licence or passport.  If you do not have such identity\r\nverification then we will require a photograph certified by an acceptable countersignatory confirming your identity.  \r\nPlease see www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications for details of acceptable counter signatories.  Please contact\r\nJordan Swinburn to obtain a form for your counter signatory to complete which will then satisfy the lenders required\r\nguarantee.\r\nAdditionally, your name and/or address on the title deeds and mortgage offer must match exactly.  \r\nIf there is a name discrepancy we will need to evidence your full correct name by reference to your\r\nbirth/marriage/divorce/deed poll certificate(s) (we will require the original(s) but will return these to you immediately). \r\nIf there is an address discrepancy we will need multiple address verification including: Your most recent council tax invoice\r\nAND a utility bill (not mobile telephone) dated within the last two months, or a DWP pensions letter.\r\nIf you do not have identification verification documentation, or are aware that there is a name and/or discrepancy to resolve\r\nplease let Jordan Swinburn in advance of the signing appointment, so that we can instruct your attending solicitor to obtain\r\nall necessary documentation.\r\n20"}

We can only forward these documents when all required conditions\r\nhave been satisfied and all documentation received. \r\nPlease ensure the Document Checklist has been fully completed.\r\nOn a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent\r\ncorrespondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately 15 working days from this point.   This timescale\r\nis only an estimate and is not guaranteed.  As such, we strongly recommend that you do not commit funds until we confirm\r\ncompletion is taking place, which we will do by telephone in advance.\r\nIf your case has any additional elements we will endeavour to provide a revised time estimate but, because we are often\r\nwaiting on the actions of a third party, this can be very difficult to gauge and impossible to guarantee.  Jordan Swinburn will\r\nkeep you up to date with progress on your case.\r\nOn a straightforward case, with no additional work (as detailed in our initial estimate bill and/or subsequent\r\ncorrespondence) we estimate that completion will be within approximately three to four weeks from this point. \r\nWe will endeavour to secure the earliest possible completion date (if that is what you would like) but if there is any particular\r\nurgency attaching to your case, or significance around a date (including a need to delay) please inform Jordan Swinburn so\r\nthat we can do our best to achieve your expectations.\r\n8.6\r\nCompletion arrangements\r\n \r\nMore 2 Life\u2019s solicitors Enact will contact us with a completion date once final checks have been carried out by the team\r\nthere.  We will telephone you to go through the final completion figures and to give you a final opportunity to change your\r\nmind.  \r\nPlease contact Jordan Swinburn if you are likely to be unavailable to discuss your case by telephone, at any time during the\r\nnext four weeks (on standard cases).  If we cannot reach you, we will delay completion until such time as we can speak to\r\nyou.  \r\nIf this is likely to cause you a problem, or if you have any queries about this, please let us know as soon as possible.\r\n8.7\r\nReceipt of Funds\r\nOn completion day More 2 Life\u2019s solicitors will send your funds to us.  Sometimes funds are not received until late afternoon\r\nand, in such circumstances, we may not be able to process the funds within banking hours.  We will always process your\r\nfunds on the next working day when we receive funds too late to process on the same day.\r\n  \r\nPlease contact Jordan Swinburn if you have not received your cheque within 4 working days after completion.\r\n \r\nPlease ensure that you have read and understand all sections of your mortgage report and mortgage offer. If you have any queries\r\nregarding any aspects of your equity release please do not hesitate to contact your case handler Jordan Swinburn. We will not proceed\r\nto completion with the equity release until you are happy with all of the Terms and Conditions outlined above. \r\n21"}

You must sign the Legal Charge in front of a Solicitor, Chartered Legal\r\nExecutive, Licensed Conveyancer or Barrister (who should have a current practising certificate and professional indemnity insurance).  For\r\nconvenience, all will be referred to as \u201cSolicitor\u201d for the purposes of this statement.\r\nWe Susan Mary McVay and Ray McVay\r\nOf 23 Park Lane, Colney Heath, St Albans, AL4 0NR\r\nMAKE THIS STATEMENT OF TRUTH as follows:-\r\n1. \r\nWe confirm we instructed Equilaw (\"my solicitor\") to act on our behalf in this matter and that we were told by Infinity Mortgages\r\nthat we were free to instruct a solicitor of our choice.\r\n2. \r\nWe are fully satisfied that our solicitor has properly advised us on the nature effects and implications of our entering into the\r\nEquity Release plan.\r\n3. \r\nWe have read a copy of our solicitors Equity Release report dated 02/12/2022 and we are satisfied with the contents therein and\r\nfully understand the same. \r\n4. \r\nWe are not suffering from any physical or mental condition that prevents me/us from understanding the advice I/we have had or\r\nwill receive from my/our solicitor (\u201cEquilaw\u201d) or which precludes me/us from entering into the equity release contract. \r\n5. \r\nWe are aware of the implications should we decide to participate in the \u201cHomes for Ukraine scheme\u201d and that we MUST inform\r\nour lender and obtain their consent BEFORE taking in any occupiers, including Ukrainian or other refugees.  If we fail to do so, we\r\nwill immediately breach the terms and conditions of our mortgage, for which the lender can request and/or take action to\r\nremediate the situation.  If the lender incurs any loss as a result of such an occupier moving in with us, they can pursue us for that\r\nloss.\r\n6. \r\nThe interest on this loan will roll-up (where we are not making any repayments) and the cost of this interest plus the capital of the\r\nloan could wipe out the whole of the value of our Property in due course. This means that we would not be able to leave our\r\nProperty or any part of it to beneficiaries under our Will.\r\n7. \r\nWe are not under any undue influence or external pressure from any other party (including our family members) to proceed with\r\nthis equity release contract. \r\n8. \r\nWe have been advised to seek independent expert legal and financial advice in relation to any gift or loan of money which we will\r\nmake from the equity release contract. \r\n9. \r\nWe are aware that the Equity Release plan is intended to run for the rest of our lives or until the last owner occupier has passed\r\naway or gone into permanent residential care. Early repayment charges are usually repayable should we decide to repay the loan\r\nearly or if we decide to sell the property and live elsewhere. The maximum charge payable in this case is \u00a311123.99 as set out in\r\nsection 13 of the mortgage offer. Accessing any further draw down will result in a higher charge being payable.\r\n10. \r\nWe have been advised to discuss the equity release contract with my family and other beneficiaries and am aware that taking out\r\nthe equity release plan will reduce the value of the assets we may wish to leave to others.\r\n11. \r\nWe confirm that we have been advised that Equilaw must notify the Lender of any material change in circumstances that may\r\nprevent the Equity Release from completing (for example (but not limited to) something affecting the applicant(s) such as\r\ndeterioration in health, or something affecting the property such as boundary dispute).\r\nWe are aware that Equilaw must be notified as soon as reasonably possible should our circumstances change.\r\n12. \r\nWe are aware that the lender does have the right after we or the last owner occupier dies or moves into permanent residential\r\n22"}

Please read this information carefully and return the instruction form on the last page to us duly completed. If you\r\nhave any queries please contact us to discuss.\r\nJoint Tenancy\r\nThe property is not owned in specified shares, but jointly own the whole.  If one of the joint owners dies, their interest passes\r\nautomatically to the surviving owner(s).  This right of survivorship overrides any Will the deceased owner may have made.\r\nCouples who are divorcing or separating must seriously consider whether the joint tenancy should be severed in order to prevent this\r\nright of survivorship operating.  By severing the joint tenancy, the owners automatically become tenants in common (as discussed below)\r\nand this would enable them to leave their interest in the property to whom they choose in their Will.\r\nIf the property is to be sold, and there is no agreement over the division in the proceeds of sale, the Courts would have to be involved to\r\nmake a decision. \r\nTenancy in Common\r\nThe property is jointly owned in specific shares e.g. 50/50.  When one of the owners dies, their interest passes according to the\r\nDeceased\u2019s wishes expressed in their Will (or according to the law of intestacy).\r\nWhat if a jointly owning couple separate?\r\nIf a married couple are divorcing, the Family Court has wide powers to order a financial settlement under s.25 Matrimonial Causes Act\r\n1973.  The powers include an order for sale of a property or one spouse transferring their interest in the property to the other.  These\r\npowers only come in to play in the event of a divorce.  The UK Courts do not recognise any form of agreement or attempt to override the\r\nCourt\u2019s powers such as a \u201cPre-Nuptual Agreement\u201d.\r\nUnmarried couples, living together, can also make claims against each other should the relationship end and they are unable to agree\r\nhow the property should be dealt with.  Court proceedings can be brought under Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996. \r\nThe Court will consider how long the parties have been together, each party\u2019s financial contribution to the property and their way of life\r\ne.g. how domestic and utility bills have been paid, redecoration carried out and gardens landscaped etc.\r\nA Declaration of Trust can be entered into upon purchasing the property which sets out the proposed property division for each party\r\nshould the relationship end.  The Court is not bound by this Declaration and may view it simply as an intention of mind at the time when\r\nit was entered into.  The Declaration is one of many factors the Court will consider and which can be overridden by the Court, especially if\r\nthe relationship has been a long one.\r\nIn recent years partners have entered into written Cohabitation Agreements (also known as Living Together Agreements), as above the\r\nCourt would view these as an intention of mind at the time they were entered into, and would not bind a Court.\r\nBusiness Property\r\nWhere a property is purchased by two or more partners as a business enterprise, it is normally acquired by the partners as Tenants In\r\nCommon.  It is then advisable to stipulate the percentage share of each partner. Most Equity Release providers stipulate that the\r\nproperty must not be used for business, although there are specific Buy to Let equity release products available.\r\nWhat if a joint owner becomes bankrupt?\r\nThe Bankrupt\u2019s interest in the property passes initially to the Official Receiver as interim Receiver and Manager and subsequently either\r\nstays with the Official Receiver, or is passed to a private sector Licensed Insolvency Practioner, as a Trustee in Bankruptcy.\r\nWhere the property is owned as Joint Tenants there is a presumption that the interest which passes into the Bankruptcy is 50%.  Where\r\nthere is a Tenancy in Common specifying the share, then the Bankrupt owner\u2019s share enters into the Bankruptcy and nothing else. "}

Please read this information carefully and return the instruction form on the last page to us duly completed. If you\r\nhave any queries please contact us to discuss.\r\nJoint Tenancy\r\nThe property is not owned in specified shares, but jointly own the whole.  If one of the joint owners dies, their interest passes\r\nautomatically to the surviving owner(s).  This right of survivorship overrides any Will the deceased owner may have made.\r\nCouples who are divorcing or separating must seriously consider whether the joint tenancy should be severed in order to prevent this\r\nright of survivorship operating.  By severing the joint tenancy, the owners automatically become tenants in common (as discussed below)\r\nand this would enable them to leave their interest in the property to whom they choose in their Will.\r\nIf the property is to be sold, and there is no agreement over the division in the proceeds of sale, the Courts would have to be involved to\r\nmake a decision. \r\nTenancy in Common\r\nThe property is jointly owned in specific shares e.g. 50/50.  When one of the owners dies, their interest passes according to the\r\nDeceased\u2019s wishes expressed in their Will (or according to the law of intestacy).\r\nWhat if a jointly owning couple separate?\r\nIf a married couple are divorcing, the Family Court has wide powers to order a financial settlement under s.25 Matrimonial Causes Act\r\n1973.  The powers include an order for sale of a property or one spouse transferring their interest in the property to the other.  These\r\npowers only come in to play in the event of a divorce.  The UK Courts do not recognise any form of agreement or attempt to override the\r\nCourt\u2019s powers such as a \u201cPre-Nuptual Agreement\u201d.\r\nUnmarried couples, living together, can also make claims against each other should the relationship end and they are unable to agree\r\nhow the property should be dealt with.  Court proceedings can be brought under Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996. \r\nThe Court will consider how long the parties have been together, each party\u2019s financial contribution to the property and their way of life\r\ne.g. how domestic and utility bills have been paid, redecoration carried out and gardens landscaped etc.\r\nA Declaration of Trust can be entered into upon purchasing the property which sets out the proposed property division for each party\r\nshould the relationship end.  The Court is not bound by this Declaration and may view it simply as an intention of mind at the time when\r\nit was entered into.  The Declaration is one of many factors the Court will consider and which can be overridden by the Court, especially if\r\nthe relationship has been a long one.\r\nIn recent years partners have entered into written Cohabitation Agreements (also known as Living Together Agreements), as above the\r\nCourt would view these as an intention of mind at the time they were entered into, and would not bind a Court.\r\nBusiness Property\r\nWhere a property is purchased by two or more partners as a business enterprise, it is normally acquired by the partners as Tenants In\r\nCommon.  It is then advisable to stipulate the percentage share of each partner. Most Equity Release providers stipulate that the\r\nproperty must not be used for business, although there are specific Buy to Let equity release products available.\r\nWhat if a joint owner becomes bankrupt?\r\nThe Bankrupt\u2019s interest in the property passes initially to the Official Receiver as interim Receiver and Manager and subsequently either\r\nstays with the Official Receiver, or is passed to a private sector Licensed Insolvency Practioner, as a Trustee in Bankruptcy.\r\nWhere the property is owned as Joint Tenants there is a presumption that the interest which passes into the Bankruptcy is 50%.  Where\r\nthere is a Tenancy in Common specifying the share, then the Bankrupt owner\u2019s share enters into the Bankruptcy and nothing else. "}
